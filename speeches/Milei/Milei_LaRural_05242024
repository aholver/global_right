Words from President Javier Milei in La Rural

Clearly, my presence and my visit to La Rural is a clear sign of support for this sector, which is so important in Argentine history and for the future of the country. At the same time, I want you to keep in mind that, just as we have worked in the exchange market to end the gap, which at some point may have some oscillation with what is happening, we are also working hard to eliminate the stocks. And that, when we finish defusing all the bombs that the Kirchnerists left us, there will be a free exchange rate.

And obviously, as the fiscal accounts begin to be recomposed and economic growth returns, first we are going to eliminate the COUNTRY Tax and then the withholdings will follow, so that the countryside is completely free.

So, according to the things that I have promised in the campaign, we are fulfilling them, we are only finishing deactivating the bombs that Kirchnerism left us, but believe me, we are going to be free and we are going to move forward, and the field is going to have a fundamental role.

Thanks a lot. Long live freedom, damn it. Long live freedom, damn it. Long live freedom, damn it.
