Words from the President of the Nation, Javier Milei, and the Minister of Defense, Luis Petri, in the announcement of the acquisition of 24 F-16 combat aircraft for the Argentine Air Force

PETRI.- Thank you very much president; Thank you very much Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. A special thanks from all forces. And simply tell them that you are transforming the country, you are bringing Argentina out of decades of decadence and you are taking the flags of freedom to all corners of the world; and this is also felt and resonates here in Denmark.

PRESIDENT.- Dear Luis. This task that we are carrying out is only possible because I am accompanied by a great Cabinet, with great people, great and extremely talented human beings. This is also possible thanks to this wonderful Cabinet of which you are a part. Thank you very much and -as appropriate- the libertarian harangue. Long live freedom Damn!

PETRI.- Long live!
