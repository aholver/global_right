NDA formed on principles of 'Nation First', not for power: Shri Narendra Modi Ji

June 7, 2024

Of Mother India... Of Mother India.

First of all, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the leaders of the NDA constituent parties present in this hall, all the newly elected MPs and our Rajya Sabha MPs. It is a matter of happiness for me that I have got the opportunity to welcome such a large group here today. All the comrades who have come victorious deserve congratulations, but the lakhs of workers who have worked day and night, neither saw the day nor the night and the efforts and hard work done by the workers of every party in this scorching heat, I bow my head and salute them from this central hall of Samvidhan Sadan.

Friends,

I am very fortunate that all of you have unanimously chosen me as the leader of the NDA and given me a new responsibility and for this I am very grateful to you. In my personal life, I feel a sense of responsibility. When I was speaking in this House in 2019, you all chose me as the leader and then I had emphasized on one thing - 'trust'. Today, when you give me this responsibility once again, it means that the bridge of trust between us is so strong. This unbreakable relationship is based on the strong foundation of trust and this is the biggest asset and hence these moments are also emotional for me and no amount of thanks to all of you would be enough.

Friends,

Very few people talk about these things, maybe it doesn't suit them, but look at the power of India's great democracy that today people have given NDA an opportunity to serve by forming government in 22 states of the country. This alliance of ours is in a true sense a reflection of the real spirit of India, which is embedded in the roots of India and that is why I am saying that let's take a look at 10 such states in our country where the number of our tribal brothers is impressive, decisive. NDA is serving in 7 out of 10 states where the population of tribals is high. Friends, we are dedicated to our constitution of equality of all religions and whether it is our Goa or our North East where a large number of our Christian brothers and sisters live, today we have got the opportunity to serve in those states as NDA.

Friends,

Pre-poll alliance: In the political history of India and in the history of alliances in Indian politics, a pre-poll alliance has never been as successful as the NDA and this alliance has won us a majority and I have said it many times that the words may be different but my feelings are consistent. Majority is necessary to run the government, that is a principle of democracy but consensus is very important to run the country and I want to assure the countrymen from here that the way you have given us the privilege of running the government by giving us majority, it is the responsibility of all of us that we will continuously strive for consensus and we will leave no stone unturned to take the country forward.

Friends,

It has been almost 3 decades for NDA, that is, 3 decades of NDA in 75 years of independence is not an ordinary event. This journey of 3 decades amidst our diverse democratic and social structure gives a message of great strength and today I say with great pride that there was a time when I was a part of this alliance as a worker of the organization, was connected with the systems and today while working with you sitting in the House, I have also had a relationship of 30 years with it and I can say on the basis of reality, facts that this is the most successful alliance. We can say with pride that the term is of 5 years, this alliance has successfully completed three terms of 5 years each out of 30 years and the alliance is entering the fourth term.

Friends,

If the experts of politics think about this matter with a free mind, the word free mind is very important, they will find that NDA is not a gathering of some parties to gain power or run the government, it is a group committed to Nation First with the basic spirit of Nation First and it may have been assembled in the beginning of a long period of 30 years but today I can say that there is an organic alliance in the political system of India and these values ​​can be said by late Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Shri Prakash Singh Badal, Shri Bala Saheb Thackeray, Shri George Fernandes, Shri Sharad Yadav in countless names, today the people of India have watered this seed with trust and made it a banyan tree and we all have the legacy of such great leaders and we are proud of it. In the last 10 years, we have tried to move forward and take the country forward with the same legacy, the same values ​​of NDA, as I said, if the analysts of politics will analyse with a free mind, they will see that there is a common thing in the people of NDA and that is good governance. All of them, in their respective times, during their respective tenures, whenever they got the opportunity to serve, have given good governance to the country and in a way, the moment we say NDA, it automatically becomes synonymous with good governance.

Friends,

During the tenure of all of us, whether I was in Gujarat or Babu was in Andhra or Nitish ji was in Bihar, he served Bihar a lot, welfare of the poor has been central to all of us and the country has seen 10 years of NDA, poor welfare, good governance, not only this, I can say that the country has lived it. The public has experienced for the first time what a government is, why a government exists, for whom a government exists, how a government works, otherwise there was a gap between the public and the government, we have bridged it. We have put into practice the mantra of Sabka Prayas to take the country to new heights.

Friends,

I am saying this with a lot of responsibility that in the next 10 years, in the NDA government, we will have good governance, development, quality of life in the lives of citizens and I personally have a very big dream. When I think about the prosperity of democracy, I want that the lesser the interference of the government in the lives of common people and especially the middle class, upper middle class, the stronger the democracy will be and in today's era of technology, we can do this very easily, otherwise if there are 10 tasks to be done in a day, we will ask for 10 different things. We want change. This is also an important aspect of good governance. We will write a new chapter of development, a new chapter of good governance, a new chapter of people's participation and together we will make the dream of a developed India a reality.

Friends,

In NDA and if I say in detail, any public representative of any party in the House, for me everyone is equal. When I talk about Sabka Prayas, then in the House also, whether it is Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha, everyone is equal for us and this is the only feeling due to which NDA alliance has been moving ahead strongly for 30 years. There is no one of ours or theirs. We have never held back in embracing everyone, the result of which is that we are able to win the trust of the people. Friends, we have worked with a team spirit in 2024 and have done it at the grass root level, it is not just photo ops, leaders shake hands together and you and I are in your way, everyone has done this work together till the grass root level and that is what has given us the strength of an organic alliance. We have supported each other, everyone thought that where there is a shortage, if there is any shortage, I will come, I will work hard but I will not let you fall short, where there is a shortage, every worker has shown this by living and only then victory comes. Friends, sometimes I can say that we have the experience of 10 years, the aspirations of every region of India and every citizen of India, there should be an unbreakable bond between the regional aspirations and the national aspirations, there should be such a connection that even air cannot pass between them, only then will the country move ahead.

Friends,

In this election, I would definitely like to mention something which I have seen from my perspective. NDA has strengthened the foundation of a new politics in South India. Now look at Karnataka and Telangana. Their governments were formed recently but in a moment, people lost faith, came out of the illusion and embraced NDA. Both in Karnataka and Telangana. Friends, in Tamil Nadu, I would also like to congratulate the Tamil Nadu team and our NDA group there is very large and many knew that we may not be able to win even one seat, but we will stay together in this fight and I have many NDA friends in Tamil Nadu who did not have any candidate but they worked hard to keep this flag high and hence, today, even though we could not win a seat in Tamil Nadu, the speed at which NDA's vote share has increased is giving a clear message, what is written in tomorrow?

Friends,

Be it Puducherry, Kerala, the sacrifice of hundreds of our workers in Kerala, be it UDF or LDF, if perhaps in the political life of India, if so much oppression has been done on people living with a single ideology, then only I can say that it must have happened in Kerala, more than in Jammu and Kashmir, despite that, victory was not in sight anywhere, they never lagged behind in putting in the utmost hard work, they have spent generations, spent generations and today for the first time our representative from Kerala has come to the Parliament. Friends, in Arunachal our government has been continuously formed and it is formed with huge support. In Sikkim too, our NDA government has almost clean sweep, Arunachal clean sweep, Andhra I was just asking Babu, he said historically this is the highest victory and the wind that is seen here, it is not wind but storm. Andhra has given such a huge public support to us, which is a reflection of the common man's desire for development for India and I have always experienced Mahaprabhu Jagannath, I always believe that God has many forms, but when I remember Lord Mahaprabhu Jagannath Ji, I always believe that he is the God of the poor and the revolutionary result that has come there, I am seeing a revolution and I can say with this that our dream of a developed India is in the coming 25 years, I had said 10 years, here I am saying 25 years, in the coming 25 years, with the blessings of Mahaprabhu Jagannath Ji, Odisha will be one of the growth engines in the country's development journey.

Friends,

We were discussing the results of 4th June and I was busy with my work. Later, calls started coming. I asked someone, "These are the figures, so tell me whether EVM is alive or dead because these people had decided that people's faith in Indian democracy and the democratic process should be lost and they should keep abusing EVM. I thought that this time they will take out a funeral procession of EVM but by the evening of 4th June, they were locked up and EVM silenced them. This is the power of Indian democracy, this is the power of India's impartiality, this is the power of India's electoral system, of the Election Commission. I believe and I hope that I may not hear EVM for five years but when we go in 2029, they will again start dancing with EVM. Because the chances of them improving are very less. You see, during the elections, I saw for the first time that almost every third day, the doors of the Supreme Court were knocked to obstruct the work of the Election Commission. There were many kinds of applications and there was only one group and those who have a strong distrust towards democracy, such people kept trying to obstruct using the Supreme Court. And a large part of the power of the Election Commission was wasted in the courts during the peak hours of the elections, that is, these people came into the field with so much disappointment that they put the entire attack on that institution, so that whatever the result of the elections, we defame India in front of the world. This was part of the conspiracy, friends, and the country will never forgive them. Friends, when the Indi Alliance opposes EVMs, I am not looking at it as just an election. I believe that these people are of the last century's thinking at heart. They neither understand the importance of technology nor are they ready to accept technology. And this was reflected only in EVMs, it was not reflected in UPI. When we said that the people of India will do digital transactions, today India has become famous in the world of Fintech, but they are not ready to accept it. Aadhaar has become the identity of the country today. I am seeing that many countries tell me that we have to move ahead with the Aadhaar system. How can you help? To stop Aadhaar, they went to the Supreme Court repeatedly... repeatedly... repeatedly and created problems, that is, basically, we have seen that the Indi Alliance is against progress, against modernity, against technology.

Friends,

It is also a matter of concern for this country that the attempt to underestimate the strength of India's democracy in the world is so extreme. I am beating the drum in the world that we are the Mother of Democracy and they are going to the world and telling that no, there is nothing like democracy in our country. That Modi has come here, how did that tea seller reach here, something must have gone wrong with their mindset. Their conspiracy to create distrust in the election process among the citizens of India, I believe that now the world will also be attracted to know and understand the diversity, vastness, breadth, depth of India's democracy, I am seeing this in the result of this election. Friends, when the voting was completed on the 1st and the counting on the 4th, if you look at the things in between, statements were given in a planned manner to throw the country into the fire of violence. Gathering here, reaching here, doing this here, some people will not take this thing seriously but this is very serious, you first disrespect the democracy of India, its system, and now before the results come, you create such an atmosphere that you will just set the country on fire, in every way the meaning of those words is the same, they tried to take the country in that direction, continuous efforts were made to mislead the country, efforts were made to divide the people of the country, hey elections are such a public festival that we want to unite as many people as possible, not to break them, but this was tried in every way. Friends, I believe that the results of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections will be seen from every parameter, the world believes and will believe that this is NDA's Maha Vijay and you saw how the two days went as if we have lost, this was visible everywhere because they had to do such imaginary, fraudulent things to raise the morale of their workers and friends, in the history of the alliance, if we look at it according to the figures, then this is the strongest coalition government but the effort was made not to accept this victory and to keep it immersed in the shadow of defeat, but such things die a premature death and it did happen but the countrymen know that neither did we lose nor are we defeated, but our behavior after the 4th shows our identity that we know how to digest victory, our sanskars are such that frenzy does not arise in the lap of victory and neither do we have the sanskar of ridiculing the defeated. We digest victory as well and we do not nurture the disorder of ridiculing the defeated, these are our sanskars. If you ask any child that whose government was in power before the Lok Sabha elections, he will say whose government was formed after the results of NDA 24, so how did NDA lose? Brother, NDA was there before, NDA is there today and NDA will be there tomorrow as well. Just think, even after 10 years, Congress could not touch the figure of 100 and if I add the three elections of 14, 19 and 24 and say, if I add the total three elections of Congress, then we have got more seats in this election than the number of seats they got in these three elections and I can see it clearly. Friends, the people of Indi do not realize that they were sinking slowly earlier, now they are going to sink at a fast pace. Friends,Even today, the common citizens of the country belonging to the Indi Alliance have not been able to understand the power of their understanding or they do not want to understand it. The common man of India also has an understanding and the one who stays connected to the ground, touches, understands and recognizes the understanding is not there. Friends, the behaviour of these people, I was hoping that after the 4th, they will respect democracy but from their behaviour it seems that we will have to wait longer for them to develop these values ​​and I cannot say much and these are the people who insult the PM of their own party, tear apart his decisions, there were no chairs for foreign guests of their own party, you have seen all these scenes and I believe that in all these situations we will see the strength of democracy and faith in the people, comrades, democracy teaches us to respect everyone, I also congratulate the MPs who have won in the opposition and I was missing one thing in the last 10 years that is debate, participation, quality of debates, but I hope that now this new House has been formed, I will not miss that, perhaps our colleagues will also come to the House with the intention of national interest and even though they may be sitting in the opposition, they are not in opposition of the nation, they are in opposition to us, in the nation we all are in the same direction, we do not have any party or opposition in the nation, the nation We are 140 crore people and I hope that they will come to the House with a spirit of national interest and they will contribute in some way to make the House prosperous.

Friends,

The mandate of 24 is reinforcing one thing again and again that in today's environment, the country trusts only and only NDA and when there is such unwavering faith, so much trust, then naturally the expectations of the country will also increase and I consider this to be good and also consider it the duty of all of us and to fulfil these expectations and I had said earlier also that the 10 years of work we have done is just a trailer and that was not my election slogan, this is my commitment that we should not delay even a bit in fulfilling the aspirations of the country more rapidly, in detail and at a faster pace. The public wants us to deliver more than before, the public wants us to break our old records ourselves and friends, if I keep NDA on one hand and keep the dreams and resolutions of the people of India on the other hand, then I would say NDA- New India, Developed India, Aspirational India and to fulfil these dreams and resolutions is also our resolution, commitment and we also have a road map.

Friends,

NDA has always given corruption free, reform oriented, stable government to the country. Whenever we got an opportunity, we have worked. In front of that, Congress led UPA has changed its name to improve its old image but it is known for scams and scams are being seen every day and despite changing the name, the country has not forgotten their scams, has rejected them and I can say that friends, due to the one point agenda of one person's approach, the people of the country have put them in opposition. NDA went to the elections with the resolution of developed India, went with positive thinking for the country, went with the talk of moving the country forward by understanding the potential of the youth power of the country and bringing new opportunities, whereas the people who were in front of us were spreading confusion, spreading lies and misleading people. Now look at NDA and theirs, even if you go to the nomination, you will see their election campaign, their nomination, see each and every scene of ours and see each and every scene of theirs, how big is the difference, their character is visible in everything and what about the photo off, so they declared alliance but in so many states they kept fighting among themselves, kept stabbing each other in the back in the electoral battle, sometimes they said this is our ideological alliance, that is fine at the level of ideology, rest we will prepare our own and now again they said we will make alliance on the basis of seats, even if we don't do the total, they also played this game and just now the elections got over and they started saying that this was our alliance for the Lok Sabha elections, not for later, they also started this, that means I had said long ago that you should see that after 4th June, the disintegration will start and that has already started, it means that they used to try to support each other only for the comforts of power, but if they had a definite self-interest in it, then they would support or else not, this was their character. Friends, these people have been telling so many big lies and you see, during the elections, they distributed pamphlets to mislead the common man of the country, saying that they will give this and that, and they will give this and that, they will give that and that, for the last two days I have been seeing that people are standing in queues outside the Congress offices, saying that there is a slip, where is the one lakh rupees, bring it brother, people are asking for it, that is, how did you mislead the people, what kind of dust did you throw in their eyes, that poor common man used to think that yes brother he will get the money after 4th June, so he went and stood there and now he is being pushed, beaten with sticks, he is being thrown out from there, now this type of election, in itself is an insult to the poor of the country, an insult to the common citizens of our country and the country never forgets such acts, neither does it ever forgive them.

Friends,

It is a matter of satisfaction for us that we have been working with a commitment. In 10 years, we have brought 25 crore poor people out of poverty. We have given them a safe and strong shield for poor welfare. A new aspiration has arisen in them that yes, now I do not want to remain poor and for that, I will take advantage of every opportunity that I can. There is no figure to say that three crore poor people will get houses. I know how much hard work it takes but we have been able to do it successfully. We have given houses to four crore people. We will move forward from today with a resolution of three crore houses. This is also a courage that after giving four crore houses to the families that have expanded, there has been a need and the states also have a desire for it. Resolution to build three crore new houses. Provision of free treatment up to Rs 5 lakh for citizens above the age of 70 years. Under the Mudra Yojana, arrangements have been made for our youth to get loans of up to Rs. 20 lakhs from their banks for business. I think that these are the guarantees of our third term. I am not revealing everything right now but we are committed to these guarantees and we will leave no stone unturned to fulfill them. Friends, empowerment of the poor and facilities for the middle class are our priorities because the middle class is now a very big driving class of this country. I see such new forces in India's growth story which are going to become our biggest strength and therefore we will work equally on that and on how to increase the savings of the middle class, how to make savings, what can we do for their quality of life, how to expand our schemes, how to make changes in our policies and rules. We will also work on this in the coming days.

Friends,

Active participation of women power from Panchayat to Parliament is our commitment and in our last tenure, we took it forward by making Nari Shakti Bandhan Act and the day is not far when a large number of our mothers and sisters will be seen leading the country in our House. In this entire election, we have been the party giving tickets to the maximum number of women candidates, this is our commitment. I especially thank the people of the country for the blessings they have given to our women MPs and friends, you must have seen that in the G-20 Summit, we have gone to the world with a lot of insistence with a topic and that is Empowerment of Women, Development of Women, we are familiar with all these things, we have made a new shift and we are taking it forward from the G20 Summit as well, Women Led Development. Once our kind of commitment is made, the change is clearly visible.

Friends,

This tenure of the NDA is of big decisions, of rapid development and now we do not want to waste time as we have to move from number five economy to number three economy and it is not just a matter of numbers five and three, the stature of the economy which is formed because of this, it becomes easier to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of the common man. There is the capability to easily fulfill the needs of the country and therefore we want to move ahead in that direction by making a big effort. The cooperation of the states is equally important in this and the kind of guidelines that the Constitution of India has given us for cooperative federalism, but I have insisted that there should be a competitive cooperative federalism, there should be healthy competition among our states, there should be healthy competition between the state and the center, we should compete to do well and we want to move ahead in that direction and we have seen that when I talk about competitive cooperative federalism, you saw that we could have held the G-20 summit at one place, we could have also got our photos clicked wearing garlands, but more than 200 meetings were held in many cities of India and the policy makers from all over the world, say from the G-20 countries and the other five-seven countries, they went to every corner of India and after going to their countries, they are discussing the diversity and vastness of India, this is a surprise for them, we used to come to Delhi and go back, we did not know that the country is so big, this is an introduction to one of our strengths. We saw during Covid the way we fought in cooperation with the states and fought unitedly, no matter which party is in power, we did this work because we have a commitment towards cooperative federalism. Aspirational district is such a model of governance in which states are also actively associated with us and for the developing countries of the world, such a model of governance is being presented which many universities of the world have started doing case studies of as case studies. Now we are taking it forward towards aspirational blocks so that even at our grass root level, the weak areas where the facilities are also below the normal average, we want to bring them to the stage average as soon as possible. Whatever be the region of the country, we will move forward with all-round development. Friends, in the last 10 years we have brought about a very big change in the field of infrastructure, that is, we have brought about a change in thinking, we have brought it on the ground, otherwise people in our country will think that we should do it once, we don't want any change in all of that, now we want something good, something big, something that can be delivered as quickly as possible, we have also inspired the mind of the common man with this and by making efforts we have worked in that direction. In five years, we have worked on Gati Shakti, that is, on this type of platform, which has been done for 6-6 years.What used to take 8-8 months can now be done in 15-20 days. We are working using all the technology and when this happens, its main benefit is that there are a lot of employment opportunities for the youth of the country. There is a huge scope for selection in life for them and that is giving us friends, today India is emerging as a new manufacturing hub for the world and when we are saying manufacturing hub, I am not just talking about electronic goods or services, I am also talking about food processing, today we are progressing very fast in the world and that is going to give a lot of strength to the farmers of India. Similarly, whether it is space, artificial intelligence, startups, skill job opportunities, today India will progress very fast, I believe it is progressing. Friends, Mudra Yojana, Drone Didi, Vishwakarma Yojana, these have also given birth to new possibilities.

Friends,

The more we focus on our culture and our heritage, it will become a centre of attraction for the world and therefore we are working in that direction and I believe that for India tourism is such an avenue that we have never got such an opportunity in the last century i.e. in the last 100 years or I may say the last 100 years as we are going to get in the next 25 years. The world is going to turn towards India, now it is our job to develop the necessary arrangements for this, we should take advantage of a win-win situation by developing tourism towards our heritage and I see a lot of investment possibilities in it and this is a sector in which people of all levels earn, even the poorest of the poor earn and even the big hoteliers earn, everyone earns in it and we want to focus on tourism, there is a lot of potential. Today, the field of infrastructure has opened up and it is benefiting the people, be it airways, railways or expressways, our transport is getting better, our digital connectivity work is creating a huge positive ground for it and we will get its benefits and Vocal for Local and Regional Tourism is giving it a boost. Friends, now the world is entering a new era. When the industrial revolution took place, we went through the era of slavery, so we could not take as much benefit of the industrial revolution as we should have. Now a new era is starting, the Green Era. India has a lot of possibilities to lead it and for this, whether it is Green Hydrogen, Green Energy, Green Jobs or Green Mobility, we want to take all these subjects forward so fast that the leadership of the Green Era proves India's capability in the world. Friends, in this connection, on 5 June, when it was Environment Day and the results were declared on 4 June, an idea came to my mind on that day that we started a program on 5 June - 'One Tree in the Name of Mother'. Everyone has respect for their mother and I would also like to tell my countrymen that in the future, on your mother's birthday or any other auspicious day, plant a tree in the name of your mother and if your mother is alive, then take her photo with you and upload it on social media and if your mother is no more, plant a tree by keeping her photo and that will be respect for your mother as well as service to Mother Earth, let us serve these two mothers.

Friends,

NDA India cannot live in isolation now, India's role in the global environment is increasing day by day. When the NDA government was formed in 2014, a new curiosity was born in the whole world from that very moment, people started seeing signs of a little hope and then that change came very fast and in the last 10 years, the work that India has emphasized, today India's image has become that of a world brother, friends, the world is accepting us as a brother and when the world accepts us as a world brother, then we will have to give importance to our global responsibilities also in our coming road map and India's successful foreign policy has also given good results. We handled every crisis in such a way that the way we gave priority to human values, the result of which is that this feeling of world brotherhood has become very strong in the mind of the common man and the world has recognized India's character of service, whether it is the crisis of Ukraine or the crisis of Afghanistan, we have not left any stone unturned in any area to save our people and friends, due to this capability, the possibilities of investment in India are going to increase a lot. I would also like to tell the states to be ready by making progressive policies, the world is knocking at your door today and the state that comes with more clear policies, the state that handles those companies coming from abroad properly, is sure to get benefits and the policies that India has made, the environment that India has created, every state of India should get the benefit of it and we want to work fast in that direction. Friends, we have seen in the G-20 Summit that the world's view towards India has changed. Those who look at these things minutely would know that G-20 was going through many crises, there were ups and downs, there was also disintegration visible but after the G-20 came to India, it has been filled with new life, new strength has come and it is India's strength that it has done a great job in connecting the whole world through G-20 and the results that have come these days, after that, I spent a lot of time accepting felicitations from foreign governments over the phone and perhaps I did not have such an experience even in 2014 and 2019 as I have this time. Now almost every corner of the world, if you name it, has expressed good wishes to India or tried to talk to it, that is, this global community is introducing our strength and because of that I believe that our respect in the world as well as investment in India, both these possibilities are increasing.

Friends,

This is the 75th year of our Constitution. We want that the Constitution is not only for the protection of our constitutional institutions, it is not for working by using sections in any court. This is our sentiment, our spirit and we have to celebrate these 75 years in such a way that we take the spirit of the Constitution to the people, every person's sentiment of the Constitution, sense of duty, dedication towards many things should increase. We want to work in that direction. Friends, today the country is immersed in the celebration of 350 years of the coronation of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and it is the biggest inspiration for us because it has the spirit of nation first. As soon as we remember Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the sentiment of nation first strengthens us and that is why we are keeping this agenda forward in the country and when the 350th year celebration has come at this time, we have to improve our policy and performance and the life of the common man and there should be no delay in it. Friends, we are moving ahead with all the preparations for development, with a road map, but at the same time, we have some new MPs, some are old MPs, some are more experienced MPs as well, you must have seen that in the last two days, you must have been watching TV, I did not find a single truth in it, someone was saying this, someone was saying that, I said, brother, ask me from where do they get this information. They are running some gossip-games, by depositing anything in anybody's account, it means this is going on for a few days because such opportunities have not been received for the last 10 years, so perhaps this excitement will be a little more, but you can believe that such people will reach, Sir, I have a good relationship with the minister, I can get your number, we also do not know, friend, it is possible that this is the way to become a minister, so by mistake we also hold his hand and I do not know in what abyss he throws us sometimes, the technology is such that it is possible that a list may come out with my signature that this person has become a minister, maybe some intelligent person may also distribute departments, so these days many people are busy in forming the government, distributing ministerial posts, distributing posts, distributing systems, I request you and those who know Modi that all these efforts are futile brother. If you also receive a call from someone, verify 10 times that the person calling is really an authority, otherwise anyone will say that your name has been called, call your family in the morning, you have to come to the oath ceremony, so there is a huge army of such gossipers, some people do it out of habit, some people do it for fun and some people do it with bad intentions, I request all the MPs that we should not fall prey to all these conspiracies. Secondly, our Indi Alliance people have become expert in fake news in this election, have done double PhD, they will probably use it to the fullest, we please stay away from these things, stay away from rumours, this team sitting here is an experienced team, I also have a team that will give the right advice and hence the team together will take the right decision. Please believe that the country will not run on the basis of breaking news.

Friends, we are on our way with the resolution of a developed India and reaching the number three economy. I know that we are going to achieve this with a definite road map and I have said earlier also that my every moment is for the country, my every moment is for you people, I am available 24/7. We have to take the country forward together. Once again, the faith you people have shown in me, the love you have shown and the support you have given, I truly believe that it is a great strength of Indian democracy. I cannot express my gratitude enough to you and I assure you that I will leave no stone unturned in working hard to fulfil your hopes and expectations. For me, birth is only and only one life-one mission and that is my Bharat Mata. This mission is to work towards fulfilling the dreams of 140 crore countrymen. This mission is to free 140 crore countrymen from the problems of a thousand years that have been faced by them generation after generation and when every citizen of my country sees him with respect, he should wish that he is from India. It would be good if we could meet his eyes. I want to create this situation. His heart should yearn that he is an Indian. Let me shake his hand and get some energy. I want to take the country to this height and friends, I am sure that your support, your cooperation, your experience has brought possibilities of very big results. This formation of Lok Sabha will fulfill all those aspirations. Once again, I thank you all from the bottom of my heart.
