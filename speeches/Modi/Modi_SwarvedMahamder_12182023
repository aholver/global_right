Sri Sadguru Charan Kamalebhyo Namah!

Hon’ble Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath ji, my colleague in the Union Cabinet, Mahendra Nath Pandey ji, Minister in the Uttar Pradesh government, Anil ji, Sadguru Acharya Pujya Shri Swatantra Dev ji Maharaj, Pujya Shri Vigyan Dev ji Maharaj, other eminent personalities, all the devotees who have gathered from across the country, and my family members!

Today is the second day of my stay in Kashi. As always, every moment spent in Kashi is extraordinary in itself, filled with wonderful experiences. You may recall that we gathered in a similar manner for the annual celebration of the All India Vihangam Yoga Institute two years ago. Once again, I have the opportunity to participate in the historic event of the centenary celebration of the Vihangam Yoga Sant Samaj. The Vihangam Yoga practice has completed its unforgettable journey of 100 years. Maharshi Sadafal Dev ji illuminated the divine light of knowledge and yoga in the last century. In these hundred years, this divine light has transformed the lives of millions of people worldwide. On this auspicious occasion, a grand event of 25,000 Kundiya Swarved Gyan Mahayajna is also taking place here. I am pleased and confident that every offering in this Mahayajna will strengthen the resolution and empower the ‘Viksit Bharat’. On this occasion, I express my heartfelt reverence to Maharshi Sadafal Dev ji and dedicate my sincere feelings to him with full faith. I also salute all the saints who are constantly advancing his guru tradition.

My family members,

The people of Kashi, in the presence of saints, have achieved many new milestones in development and reconstruction. The government, society, and saints are working together for the transformation of Kashi. The completion of the Swarved Mandir today is an example of this divine inspiration. This grand temple is a symbol of the teachings and guidance of Maharshi Sadafal Dev ji. The divinity and grandeur of this temple are equally enchanting and astonishing. While visiting the temple, I myself became mesmerized by its beauty. The Swarved Mandir is a modern symbol of Bharat’s social and spiritual prowess. I observed that Swarved is beautifully depicted on its walls, along with divine messages from scriptures such as Vedas, Upanishads, Ramayana, Gita, and Mahabharata. Therefore, this temple is a living example of spirituality, history, and culture. Thousands of practitioners can engage in Vihangam Yoga practice together here. Hence, this grand temple is not only a pilgrimage for yoga but also a pilgrimage of knowledge.

I congratulate the Swarved Mahamandir Trust for this marvellous spiritual construction and extend my congratulations to the millions of followers. Especially, I express special congratulations to Pujya Swami Shri Swatantra Dev ji and Pujya Shri Vigyan Dev ji, who have successfully completed this endeavour.

My family members,

Bharat is a nation that has been an example of economic prosperity and physical development for centuries. We have established benchmarks of progress and reached the steps of prosperity. Bharat has never allowed physical development to become a means of geographical expansion and exploitation. For physical progress, we have also created spiritual and human symbols. We have sought the blessings of vibrant cultural centres like Kashi and built temples like Konark! We have constructed inspiring stupas in Sarnath and Gaya. Universities like Nalanda and Taxila were founded here! Therefore, our art and culture have touched unimaginable heights around these spiritual structures of Bharat. Here, new paths of knowledge and research have opened, giving birth to limitless possibilities linked with initiatives and industries. Science like yoga has flourished alongside faith, and it is from here that a continuous flow of human values has spread throughout the world.

Brothers and sisters,

In the era of slavery, those oppressors who attempted to weaken Bharat first targeted these symbols of ours. The reconstruction of these cultural symbols was necessary after gaining independence. If we respected our cultural identity, a sense of unity and self-respect would have strengthened within the country. Unfortunately, this did not happen. There was opposition even to the reconstruction of the Somnath Temple after independence. This mindset prevailed over the country for decades. As a result, the nation fell into the abyss of inferiority, forgetting to take pride in its heritage.

But brothers and sisters,

The wheel of time has turned once again after seven decades of independence. The country is now proclaiming liberation from the 'mentality of slavery' and ‘pride in its heritage' from the Red Fort. What began at Somnath has now become a movement. Today, the grandeur of the Vishwanath Dham in Kashi is narrating the saga of Bharat’s eternal glory. Today, Mahakal Mahalok is giving evidence of our immortality. Today, Kedarnath Dham is also reaching new heights of development. By developing the Buddha Circuit, Bharat is once again inviting the world to the land of Buddha's enlightenment. The development of the Ram Circuit is also progressing rapidly in the country. And in the coming weeks, the construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya is also going to be completed.

Friends,

We can only progress towards comprehensive development when the country incorporates its social truths and cultural identity. That's why today, the development of our pilgrimage sites is happening, and Bharat is setting new records in modern infrastructure. What is the pace of development in the country can be evident from Banaras alone. Two weeks ago, the construction of the Kashi Vishwanath Dham marked the completion of two years. Since then, Banaras has witnessed a new surge in employment and business. Earlier, there used to be concerns upon reaching the airport about how to reach the city! Bad roads, disorder everywhere—this was the identity of Banaras. But now, Banaras means development! Now, Banaras means modern facilities with tradition! Now, Banaras means cleanliness and change!

Banaras is advancing on the unique path of development today. In the last nine years, historic work has been done to increase connectivity in Varanasi. Roads connecting Varanasi to all cities have either been expanded to four lanes or six lanes. A completely new Ring Road has also been built. The network of new roads in Varanasi is being laid out, developing both old and new areas. Railway stations in Banaras are being developed, new trains are starting from Banaras, work on dedicated freight corridors is underway, airport facilities are expanding, ghats on the Ganges are being renovated, cruises are sailing on the Ganges, modern hospitals are being built in Banaras, a new and modern dairy is being established, providing assistance to farmers along the Ganges for natural farming—our government is leaving no stone unturned in the development of this place. Training institutes have also been opened here for the skill development of the youth of Banaras. Thousands of young people have also found employment through Sansad Rozgar Mela.

Brothers and sisters,

The mention of this modern development is essential because the lack of infrastructure poses the biggest challenge in our spiritual journeys. For instance, pilgrims coming to Banaras would want to visit the Swarved Mandir, which is located outside the city. However, if the roads were not as they are today, fulfilling this wish would have been challenging even with the desire to do so. But now, the Swarved Mandir will emerge as a major destination for pilgrims coming to Banaras. This will create opportunities for business and employment in all surrounding villages, paving the way for the progress of the people.

My family members,

The Vihangam Yoga Institute, as dedicated to our spiritual well-being, is equally active in serving society. This is the tradition of sages like Sadafal Dev ji. Alongside being a dedicated yogi, Sadafal Dev ji was also a freedom fighter during the independence movement. Today, it is the responsibility of each follower to advance his resolutions in the ‘Amrit Kaal’ of independence. Last time I was among you, I presented some expectations for the country. Today, once again, I am presenting nine resolutions before you. And just now Vigyan Dev ji also reminded me of what I had said last time. These are:

First – Save every drop of water and actively raise awareness for water conservation.

Second - Go to villages, make people aware of digital transactions and teach online payments to them.

Third - Work to make your village, your neighbourhood and your city number one in cleanliness.

Fourth - Promote local products as much as possible, use Made in India products.

Fifth - As much as possible, visit your own country first, travel within your country, and if you want to go to other countries, do not feel like going abroad until you have seen the whole country. I say to these wealthy people too, why are you getting married abroad? I say ‘Wed in India’, get married in India.

Sixth- Keep farmers more and more aware of organic farming. I made this request to you last time too, and I am repeating it. This is a very important campaign to save Mother Earth.

Seventh - Include millets and Shree Anna in your daily diet, promote it well, it's a superfood.

Eighth- Make fitness, yoga, sports also an integral part of your life.

Ninth - Become a support for at least one poor family, help them. This is necessary to eradicate poverty in Bharat.

These days, you are witnessing the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’. I participated in a program related to it yesterday evening. In a little while from now, I am once again going to be a part of the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’. It is everyone's responsibility, including all spiritual leaders, to spread awareness about this ‘yatra’. I would like everyone to also make personal resolutions for this ‘yatra’. If the ideal phrase 'Gaavon Vishwasya Maatarh' becomes a part of our faith as well as our behaviour, then Bharat will develop rapidly. With this sentiment, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you, and I also thank the revered saints for the honour they have bestowed upon me! Let's speak together -

Bharat Mata Ki – Jai!

Bharat Mata Ki – Jai!

Bharat Mata Ki – Jai!

Thank you.
