December 3, 2018

This land is the land of Sant Sukhram Das Ji. I have once again got the privilege of paying my obeisance to this land of Sant Sukhram Das Ji. Where Maa Chamunda resides, which is the place of penance of sage Mandu, where every particle of the place has the tales of the bravery of Rao Chandrasen Ji, Durgadas Rathore and Amar Singh Rathore who inspired Rao Jodha Maharana Pratap. Where a vibrant society lives that lives and dies for nature and the environment. I once again bow down to the blue city of Jodhpur, the Marwar that gave the mantra of success in trade and business to the country and the world, and to every person of entire Marwar.

Just two days ago, it was Major Shaitan Singh's birthday. I salute his bravery and the brave men of Rajasthan. Jodhpur has bravery in its arms and the same sweetness and intimacy in its tongue. Along with the sweets of Jodhpur, the dialect here is also equally sweet. The taste of Pyaaz Kachori and Mirchi Bade is heard on everyone's tongue in the country and abroad. No one can be angry due to the sweetness of the dialect of the people here. If you want to learn hospitality and persuasion, then you have to learn it from Jodhpur only. I once got the opportunity to work for the organization in Rajasthan, so when I used to meet the workers of Jodhpur, they used to tell me about the sweet dialect of Jodhpur. They used to say that the mother-in-law was doing some work outside the house and the daughter-in-law came running out and started saying - mother-in-law, mother-in-law, sit in the stove like a scorpion. In the land where even a scorpion is called a scorpion, so much sweetness and so much love.

Brothers and sisters, this Marwar, this Jodhpur has been an unconquerable fort of the Bharatiya Janata Party for many years. And that is because of your blessings. This is because of your strength. And I have experienced every time that when our opponents come here, they throw so much mud, they throw so much mud, but they do not know, these Congress people do not know that the more mud you throw, the more the lotus will bloom. And in spreading these lies, the Congress has become such a university, such a school, where the study of PhD in lies starts as soon as one enters. And the one who gets high marks and becomes proficient in telling lies, he is given new posts and titles.

Brothers and sisters, they lie every day, they lie wherever they get a chance, they lie without any basis, they extract lies out of thin air like a magician. Brothers and sisters, if the Congress people are in this election thinking that by telling lies their vehicle will move ahead, then I say with confidence that their dreams have been shattered in every state of India, the same situation is going to happen here too. These Congress people believe that there is no need to do anything in politics. Hey, development, development is all useless talk. One Congress leader says, leave this development brother, make the equation of castes and make the vote contractors yours, the vehicle will move ahead. Do we want to let the country run like this…. Do we want to hand over Rajasthan in the hands of such people…. They spread such lies that they do not have to do anything. All the journalists who come from Delhi and analyze the elections here, ask the Congress leaders. When they come back to Delhi, we ask them, brother, tell us what news have you brought. So what news do you bring…they said, Congress people are having a good time. I asked what mood he was in. He said that the people of Rajasthan have decided that once Congress, once BJP, once Congress, once BJP. And so this time it is our turn and we don't need to do anything. Brothers and sisters, they have filled the mind of Delhi media with such lies that when I remind them that this land gave Bhairon Singh Shekhawat the opportunity to form the government twice. And this time also, the land of Rajasthan is not going to accept the lies of Congress, this foolish logic of Congress under any circumstances. If Rajasthan Congress believes that people will mortgage Rajasthan for five years, oh those days are gone.

Brothers and sisters, tell me why governments are formed in elections. After all we vote in elections, we form governments, why do we form them. We form governments so that our problems are solved, some good work is done. Do we form governments to build roads where there are no roads or not…. Do we form governments to provide electricity where there is no electricity or not…. Do we form governments to provide good education to children where they do not have good education or not…. This means that should such development issues be discussed in elections or not…. I want to ask all of you whether development issues should be discussed or not…. You have heard the speeches of so many Congress leaders, do they make even one speech regarding the development of Rajasthan…. Do they say even one thing…. What do they say, they have just said something new and he is a Namdaar brother, he has the right to say everything and we are workers, we will have to listen. This Namdaar has the right to say everything. These days, in the elections, they are saying that Modi has no knowledge of Hinduism. Hey brother, does Modi have knowledge or not, do we have to cast votes on this issue in Rajasthan… Rajasthan needs votes for electricity, roads, water or does it need votes on whether Modi has knowledge of Hinduism or not. They are talking about this, I am not able to understand brother. Yes, I will definitely say this, this is a culture, this is a tradition that is thousands of years old. This is a storehouse of knowledge that has come out of the penance of sages and saints. This Hinduism, which has stood the test of every age, is a vast heritage. And this Hinduism, this knowledge of Hinduism is so deep, so deep, so vast, so ancient, so immortal, it is higher than the Himalayas, deeper than the ocean. Even sages and saints never claimed that they have complete knowledge of Hindus and Hinduism. No one has done it, it is so vast that even after millions of births, it is not possible for a human being to gather all this knowledge. This is just a small worker. Modi is such a worker, I can never claim that I have this storehouse of immense knowledge. Namdars can do it, what the sages and saints could not claim, Namdars can do it. Congratulations to them for this knowledge and congratulations to the country as well so that your mind remains a little light, you get entertainment.

Brothers and sisters, a few days ago, one of their leaders raised questions on Sanatan Dharma and what kind of people are these who say that they have a deep knowledge of Hinduism. There are many aspects of Hinduism, one aspect is this - no one asks about caste, one who worships Hari is Hari's. Even a villager can tell this small definition of Hinduism. But, you are the contractor of the knowledge of Hinduism, you are asking what is Modi's caste. From where did you learn Hinduism, brother, from where did you get this knowledge of Hinduism. Brothers and sisters, I want to ask those people who talk to us about Hinduism and whether Congress likes it or not, one family has ruled for four generations and one family will have to answer for the deeds of these four generations for thousands of years. They cannot escape, it is the right of India in democracy that the four generations who have ruled the country, all those four generations will have to answer. These Hindutva scholars, I want to ask them, the country got freedom, during the period of slavery, the invaders looted the temple of Somnath and demolished it repeatedly. After the country got freedom, to destroy this symbol of slavery, the son of this country, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel went to the land of Somnath and took the water of the sea in his hand and pledged that he will destroy this symbol of slavery and will revive this temple of Somnath again. I want to ask these Hindutva scholars that when Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had pledged to rebuild the temple of Somnath, what stance did the first Prime Minister of the country and the great man of the older generation of your own family take regarding the temple of Somnath, doesn't India know that? You have come to teach us Hinduism. Not only this, today India is proudly celebrating the birthday of India's first President, Dr. Rajendra Babu. On his birthday, I bow down to him, pay my respects to him and may his great work continue to inspire us to do good work, I repeat this resolution once again. But I want to ask this Gyani Namdaar, you have such a deep knowledge of Hindutva, please tell me, when Somnath was rebuilt, Sardar Sahib did it on his own strength, despite the opposition of the then Prime Minister. But when Rajendra Babu was going for its Praan Pratishtha, the knowledge of Hindutva that you are talking about, the then Prime Minister of your own family had strongly opposed Dr. Rajendra Babu's going to Gujarat Somnath. What kind of Hindutva was that, what knowledge of Hindutva was that? Modi has never claimed it, we have come from such an ordinary family. We can never claim any knowledge, but we can claim that 125 crore countrymen are the storehouse of knowledge and they are my remote control, they are the ones who control me, that is why I walk on the right path.

Brothers and sisters, these people are roaming around carrying the flag of Hindutva, please tell me when your government was in power in Delhi, madam, when your mother used to run the government in Delhi by remote control, Namdar Sir, then the Congress led UPA government had said in writing in the Supreme Court that there is no historical proof of Lord Ram. Do you agree with this… You agree… They said that he is a fictional character. Brothers and sisters, now they are asking me whether Modi has knowledge about Hinduism or not. Can you trust those who say such things… Can you trust them…

Brothers and sisters, you must have seen that recently United Nations gave a great honour to our country for environment- Champion of Earth. You know it. People say that look Modi ji you have been honoured. I think the world does not know that this Vishnoi community on this land of my Rajasthan when the world did not know the 'G' of global warming. When the world did not know the 'P' of what is environment. For centuries the people of our Vishnoi community have sacrificed for the protection of the environment. Today the honour of Champion of the Earth that India has received, at its root there are people like Vishnoi community in every corner of the country who have a great tradition of sacrificing for the protection of the environment, due to which this has been possible. Therefore brothers and sisters, India today bows down to its great traditions, the great teachings received from the sages and saints, for these sadhanas going on for centuries. I salute every person of that community who sacrificed their life for the protection of the environment.

Brothers and sisters, even today, the tourism in Rajasthan is being promoted, so everyone remembers Bhairon Singh Shekhawat. You tell me, a desert land where there is scarcity of water, where there is a big desert and on one side there is desert and on the other side there is Pakistan. The golden opportunity for livelihood of the people here is tourism. You tell me brothers and sisters, be it Jodhpur, the entire Udaipur, our Jaisalmer, the forts of our Rajasthan, the palaces of our Rajasthan, were all these built after Modi came to power…. Were they there before Modi or not…. Were they there during the Congress era or not…. Were they there during Nehru ji’s era or not…. Were they there during Indira ji’s era or not…. Were they there during Rajiv ji’s era or not…. Were they there during the time of Namdar ji’s mother or not…. Despite that, why was tourism not growing in India? If India had emphasized on tourism from the beginning, if we had proudly presented the specialties of India to the world, then today we would have been number one in the world of tourism, brothers. If there is any biggest business in the world today, it is tourism. Tourism is a business worth trillions of dollars. But, India could not get the benefits it should have. Why…this family's thinking was that the day they hoisted the tricolor for the first time in India, history begins only after that. They were busy forgetting the earlier history and due to that tourism also suffered a lot. Brothers and sisters, tourism is such a sector where maximum employment is generated with minimum capital. There is no need to explain tourism to the people of Jodhpur. When tourism starts increasing, when tourists come, then the person selling chana-puffed rice also earns, the person selling biscuits also earns, the person selling toys also earns, the person selling bouquets and flowers also earns. Brothers and sisters, the taxi driver will earn, the auto driver will earn, the guest house owner will earn, the small hotel owner will earn, and even the tea seller will earn. You tell me whether tourism should develop or not…. Should tourists from all over the world come to India or not…. Should tourists from all over the world come to Jodhpur or not…. Should the people of Jodhpur get employment or not…. But you will be surprised to know that when their government was in power, the growth of tourism in our country did not go above four to five percent. Today I say with pride that today the growth of tourism in India has reached 10-15 percent. It has increased three to four times. You tell me whether the tourist destination Rajasthan will benefit from this or not…. Will it benefit or not…. Brothers and sisters, last year one crore tourists have come to our country, one crore. We know very well the leaders who go abroad and abuse India to defame it. Despite this, the world has acknowledged the power of India, has accepted the strength of India and the attraction towards India is increasing. Today, people are coming to India for marriages and to know how Indian marriages are, what are the traditions, our country is gradually becoming a destination for marriages. Be it Goa, Kerala or Rajasthan, people are turning here.

Brothers and sisters, cleanliness is the first condition of tourism. You tell me brothers, did Mahatma Gandhi dream of a clean India or not? Did Mahatma Gandhi keep urging people for cleanliness throughout his life or not? Is this topic of cleanliness something new? Are you unaware of it? You tell me, there have been so many Prime Ministers, four generations of them, did you ever hear from their mouths about fulfilling Gandhiji's wish? Tell me the truth, did you hear? Did they shatter Gandhiji's dreams or not? Did they forget Gandhiji or not? Because they knew that if that Fakir Gandhi is remembered, then who will remember this Namdaar Gandhi? Therefore, in forgetting that Fakir Gandhi, they also forgot the cleanliness of the country. Brothers and sisters, the work that should have been done during the 70 years of independence, that work came to me. People were surprised that earlier governments used to come and talk big, but this Prime Minister has come who is not talking about building big bridges or big hotels from the Red Fort. He is talking about building toilets. Brothers and sisters, my head bows down in shame when any of my mothers has to go to the open to defecate. You can imagine, just think for a moment, a mother who does not have a toilet in her house, has to go for her natural work, either she goes in the dark before sunrise and comes back and if she has to go during the day, then she faces troubles, bears pain, restrains herself throughout the day and goes after the sun sets in the evening. How much pain she must be going through, did no government have the time to see this? You tell me whether my mothers and sisters should get respect or not…. Should a facility like toilet be available to our mothers and sisters or not…. So many governments have passed, they did not find it necessary and when I was talking about toilets, the same people who make fun of me today on the basis of my caste, who make fun of my knowledge of Hinduism, they used to make fun of yoga once, they also made fun of toilets and cleanliness. But, they did not know that it is the cleanliness drive that has contributed significantly in increasing tourism in India by 10 percent. It has given new employment opportunities to lakhs of youth of the country.

Brothers and sisters, you tell me and I would also like to congratulate Vasundhara ji, she also gave so much strength to this campaign of the Government of India, she gave so much strength in Rajasthan that we have built 9 crore toilets in the country. 9 crore toilets in four years is not a small figure and our Rajasthan has also done the work of giving respect to these mothers and sisters by building more than 80 lakh toilets.

Brothers and sisters, on this land where Vishnoi community sacrificed for the protection of environment, for the protection of nature, for the protection of environment, just as people remember Vishnoi community, similarly when it comes to cow protection, no one can forget Tejaji Maharaj. No one can forget his sacrifice, penance, sacrifice. Brothers and sisters, today when the world is troubled by global warming, this land has once again come forward for renewable energy, solar energy. And this entire Barmer, Jodhpur area, Jaisalmer and today Rajasthan is leading 6 big solar parks in this. The land of Rajasthan has shown what kind of result is brought by protecting nature. But, lying in this also, the leaders of Congress party here and this Rahul Gandhi are amazing, their power to lie is so much that when they come here, they call this person Chief Minister, when they go there, they call someone else Chief Minister. When they go among the tribals, they call the third person Chief Minister. Brothers and sisters, here they have told everyone that yes, your turn is coming. Because they know that they are not going to come and so what is the harm in lying. Brothers and sisters, our sister Vasundhara ji has done the work of generating 7000 MW solar energy in Rajasthan and doubling it in the last four years. This is a work of service not only for Rajasthan but for the entire humanity.

But brothers and sisters, those who shed crocodile tears in the name of farmers today should go to this area of ​​Rajasthan and see whether some special people from Delhi have come and usurped the land of the farmers here for free or not….. Have they taken it for free or not….. Have they done grave injustice to the farmers or not….. If those farmers had known that a very big solar park is going to be built here in the future, would these innocent farmer brothers of mine have given this land….. And brothers and sisters, I want to explain to you what kind of business they were running. They have kept a talisman in the name of Congress. And those who do wrong things, do bad things, loot the government treasury, siphon off money from the banks, they do not need to do anything, if they tie this talisman of Congress, they would get a protective shield. They kept looting, kept enjoying themselves. Neither did the bank ever ask for money from them, nor did the bank have any system to ask for money. Brothers and sisters, more money was given to people from banks in the country after independence than was given during the eight years from 2006 to 2014. Take it, just keep looting us. Banks were looted by making telephone calls. Namdaar would call and money would be given from the bank and this story of your Rajasthan has come in detail in the newspapers just two days ago. A steel factory sinking, enjoying itself. Those who looted lakhs and crores, what did they do? Get us the money from the bank, a fake company was formed. It bought land and the land was given to their special person. Brothers and sisters, they sat down with the bank's money. We came, we started investigating. Brothers and sisters, we made a law to take back every penny and those who considered themselves big crorepatis, we left them as paupers. Brothers, you tell me whether the money should be taken back from those who looted the country's money or not.... That is why we have made strict laws and the result of making strict laws is that those who were not ready to look at the banks after taking money from them, have been forced to return three lakh crore rupees to the banks, brothers. Right now, just with the news of making the law, the stick has been used on a few people, but most of the people have somehow deposited three lakh crore rupees in the banks. We have made a law that if you do such dishonesty, then the bank itself will become the owner of your company, the bank will give it to someone else and you will become a pauper from a millionaire. And how many more have happened...the bankruptcy law has been made so strict. Even after that if you do not pay the money, then if there is any other company of yours, which has not taken even a single rupee, the government will confiscate that company too. The government will confiscate his car, helicopter, plane. Not only this, if you have any property in any country of the world, the government will confiscate that too and that is why people are trembling.

Brothers and sisters, those who have enjoyed themselves for 70 years in collusion, tell me will they like Modi even for a minute…. Will they like Modi…. Will they like the ethical governments of BJP…. And that is why I want to say brothers and sisters, make the Bharatiya Janata Party strong. Give us a chance to serve Rajasthan once again. I assure you, I will be successful in fulfilling the things you have dreamt of in the last 70 years in the coming days. I have come to make this promise to you.

Brothers and sisters, these days lies are being spread in the name of farmers. My clear opinion is that these people who roam around planting roses, had knowledge of gardens, they had no knowledge of fields. They had no knowledge of the sweat of the farmer. If Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had become the first Prime Minister of India, then the farmers of my country would not have been in such a plight. Those who had no knowledge of farming, those people sat in the country for four generations, it is their trouble that my farmers have to suffer today. Brothers and sisters, those who are giving speeches on farming, they do not even know whether gram is a plant or a tree. Those who cannot differentiate between sesame and mustard are out to give us knowledge of farming. Swaminathan Commission had given a report in 2006 that the farmer will have to be paid one and a half times his cost. Tell me, should the report that came in 2006 be implemented in 2006 or not.... Should it have been implemented or not...... They did it.... They did it.... It was done in 2007…. It was done in 2008…. It was done in 2009…. It was done in 2010…. Brothers and sisters, until our government came to power, that file was lying there, rotting. It was not done… If it had been done at that time, my farmers would not have faced any problems, and the arrangements would have been made today. We came and fulfilled our promise. Today, for the first time after Independence, if anyone has decided to increase the cost of a farmer by 1.5 times, it is your one vote that has done it, brothers. Your vote is powerful, you voted for me, you gave me responsibility, I fulfilled my responsibility and decided to give MSP to my farmers at 1.5 times their cost price.

Brothers and sisters, tell me when Gehlot's government was in power, was urea sold in black or not.... Did one have to stand in queues at night to get urea or not.... Were farmers lathi-charged or not.... Today there is no queue for urea, urea is not sold in black anywhere. Urea is available to farmers whenever they want, in whatever quantity they want. How did it happen brother, this is the reason, Modi has put a stop to theft. Earlier urea used to be produced in the name of farmers, it used to go to chemical factories and chemical people used to make other things and earn their money. My farmers used to die without urea and the subsidy was stolen, that is a different matter. We did neem coating on urea, applied neem pod juice on urea. Now urea can be used only in the fields, it cannot be used in any factory, theft of urea stopped and urea started reaching my farmers.

Brothers and sisters, we have worked so much for the welfare of the country and then I request you to support the Bharatiya Janata Party with full strength on the 7th and form the BJP government once again so that you can ask us for an account of our work. You will never be able to ask this Namdaar for an account. Brothers, they have not given an account of four generations, if they want to give an account, we will give it. That is why I have come to request you to make all our candidates of the Bharatiya Janata Party victorious. I once again remember all my candidates - our senior leader Mrs. Suryakanta ji from Sursagar, Mrs. Kamsa Meghwal ji from Bhopalgarh, Mr. Bhaira Ram Siyol ji from Osian, Mr. Jogaram ji from Luni, Mr. Arjun Ram Gadh ji from Bilada, Mr. SS Khetasar ji from Sardarpura, Mr. Gyan Chand Parikh ji from Pali, Mr. Atul Bhansali ji from Jodhpur City, Mrs. Shobha Chauhan ji from Sojat, Mr. Joraram Kumawat ji from Sumerpur, Mr. Avinash Gehlot ji from Jaitaran. I request all of you to bless them by closing your fists and saying Bharat Maa Ki Jai.

Mother India....Victory to Mother India....Victory to Mother India....Victory to Mother India...

Thank you very much to all of you
