Na Telangana Kutumb Sabhyulaandariki Shubhabhinandanlu...
This place is known for its sugarcane farmers and sugar production. This sweetness is clearly felt in the behavior of the people here. You have come in such large numbers to bless BJP. We are all very grateful to you.

Na Kutumba Sabhyullara,
whenever I come to Telangana, I see a wave of hope among the people here, this wave is of hope, this wave is of change, this wave is of the feeling that the development of Telangana should reach the new heights it deserves. I know that the people here now want to get rid of the past of betrayal. The people here are now fed up with the 9 years of misrule of BRS and want freedom from BRS. The people here also want freedom from the Congress which despite being in power for seven decades, continuously insulted this entire region. And that is why this time the wind is in the BJP's direction. The people of Telangana have hope from BJP. The BJP's Sankalp Patra is a symbol of the aspirations of the poor, farmers, women, youth, backward and Dalits of Telangana. We are moving forward with the goal of building Sakala Janula Saubhagya Telangana. People have seen our track record in national politics. BJP does what it says. We had promised to abolish Article 370, the promise was fulfilled, we had said that triple talaq will end, the promise was fulfilled. We had talked about women's reservation in Parliament, the promise was fulfilled. We had guaranteed to give 1.5 times MSP to farmers, the promise was fulfilled. We had pledged one rank one pension to our soldiers, the promise was fulfilled. We had promised that Ram Mandir will definitely be completed, today it is being fulfilled. And friends, we had promised the people of Telangana to make a turmeric board, the BJP government has fulfilled this promise as well. We had promised you a Central Tribal University, the BJP government has fulfilled this promise as well. Modi's guarantee, Modi's guarantee means guarantee of fulfillment of guarantee. That is why today the people of BC community of Telangana are also excited because BJP has promised to make a CM from this community here. It is BJP which has given the country a record number of Union Ministers from BC community. And it is BJP which has given the country a PM from OBC community.

Congress and BRS neither worked for BC community nor did any work for Dalits. The BRS that is today was earlier TRS. These people had promised that the first CM of Telangana would be a Dalit. But when the Dalit votes were received, KCR himself occupied the CM's chair. But in contrast to this, BJP has always worked for social justice and social empowerment. BJP understands well the injustice that has been done to the Madiga community in this development journey of Telangana. The Government of India is committed to end this injustice. A committee is being formed to take the work forward at a fast pace. This committee will take the initiative to get you justice and create a new path for your empowerment. A major judicial process related to the Madiga community is also going on in the Supreme Court. We are making every possible effort to strengthen this case. Yesterday itself, I have talked in detail with the officers in Delhi on all these subjects.

Na Kutumba Sabhyullara,
Telangana farmers are known for their hard work.
But the state government has cheated them too. The BRS government had announced several irrigation schemes here, but these schemes became ATMs for BRS.
Whenever someone needs money, people go to the ATM to withdraw money. But when BRS needs money, they announce a new irrigation scheme. The cost of the projects keeps increasing, but neither any project is completed nor any project is started. The money meant for Telangana's development is going into the pockets of the family running BRS.

Na Kutumba Sabhyullara,
the welfare of farmers has always been the priority of BJP. More than 2 lakh 75 thousand crore rupees have been directly transferred to crores of farmers of the country through PM Kisan Samman Nidhi.
Around 40 lakh farmers of Telangana have also benefited from this. About
1.5 lakh farmers of Kamareddy are also among them, who have received around 400 crore rupees from this scheme. The bag of urea which costs 2.5 to 3 thousand rupees in other countries, the same bag is being made available by the BJP government to the farmers of Telangana for less than 300 rupees.

Na Kutumbha Sabhyullara,
in the past years, paddy worth more than 1.3 lakh crore rupees has been purchased here. The central government also buys boiled rice from the farmers. Now our government has decided that in this Kharif season, 20 lakh metric tonnes of boiled rice will be purchased from the farmers of Telangana. This will also benefit the farmers of Telangana a lot. The BJP government at the center is also working continuously to provide additional sources of income to the farmers. Bio-fuel plants are being set up to make fuel from the waste coming out of agriculture. To increase the income of sugarcane farmers, blending of ethanol in petrol has been increased, ethanol plants are being set up. This is a sugarcane hub. You people are also going to benefit a lot from this. Gobardhan Yojana is being run to benefit the cattle rearers. The central government is also providing free vaccination to animals by spending Rs 15 thousand crore.

Na Kutumba Sabhyullara,
Telangana is a young state. I am saddened that a young state like Telangana has got a government that is the biggest and most anti-youth, the biggest enemy of the youth. Thousands of our youth who have been preparing for TS-PSC exams for years have been cheated by the BRS government. Apart from this, these people have completely neglected the education sector. And friends, who does not know the attitude of Congress towards the youth. Thousands of youth lost their lives in the Telangana movement due to the incompetence of the Congress government. These parties are not worried about the next generation of the country, these are the people who are worried about the future generation of their family.

Na Kutumba Sabhyullara,
the people of Telangana, the people of Kamareddy, must reject both these parties. The CM of BRS and the President of Telangana Congress are both contesting elections from Kamareddy. They have also contested elections from other areas. This shows how desperate these people are. How scared they are. The people of Kamareddy have this opportunity to teach the people of Congress and BRS that their politics of nepotism, corruption and appeasement will not work anymore. BRS and Congress have one more thing in common. These two parties adopt all kinds of tricks to deceive you people. Sometimes suddenly TRS is made BRS. This year UPA has been made INDI Alliance. The people of the country understand all these tricks very well. Changing the name can never change the history of their corruption, misgovernance and vote bank politics. The truth is that in many states of the country, people have ousted Congress from power for decades. And I am confident that on December 3, the people here will remove KCR from power as well.

Na Kutumba Sabhyullara,
BJP is the only party that works for the poor. Be it Jan Dhan account, Mudra loan without guarantee, free vaccine for all the countrymen during Corona, all these arrangements have been made by BJP. BJP is also ensuring that no poor person in the country sleeps hungry. Now I have decided that for the next 5 years, the scheme which gives free ration to the poor will be extended for five years. Lakhs of my poor brothers and sisters here in Telangana will also get the benefit of this.

Na kutumbha sabhullaara,

Today, with the blessings of all of you, BJP has more than 300 MPs. There was a time in the country when we had only 2 MPs and we were made fun of. At that time, one of our two MPs was from this region. We can never forget this. How can we forget that even when we were the weakest, Telangana and Telugu people supported us. I assure you, we will always be with the people of Telangana and will keep working for your development. Even if the people of BRS and Congress think about their children, we will stand with your children.
And that is why I am fully confident that the people of Kamareddy and Telangana are going to vote for BJP this time. BJP is going to form the government, BC is going to become the Chief Minister. Once again you came in such large numbers and blessed us, I thank you very much.

Say Bharat Mata ki with me...

Mother India's...

Mother India's...

Thank you very much.
