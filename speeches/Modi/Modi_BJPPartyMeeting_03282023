Long live Mother India!

Long live Mother India!

Bharatiya Janata Party President Shri JP Nadda Ji, our guide Dr. Murli Manohar Joshi Ji, all other party officials, all respected fellow workers, ladies and gentlemen present in the program

Many congratulations to the workers of Bharatiya Janata Party across the country for the expansion of the central office of Bharatiya Janata Party. When I came to inaugurate the office in 2018, I had said that the soul of this office is our workers. Today, when we are expanding this office, it is not just the expansion of a building, but it is the expansion of the dreams of every BJP worker. It is the expansion of BJP's resolve to serve. I bow down to the feet of those crores of workers of the party. I also bow down to all the founding members of the party.

Friends,


A few days from today, our party will celebrate its 44th foundation day. This journey is a tireless and continuous journey. This journey is a journey of the pinnacle of hard work. This journey is a journey to the pinnacle of dedication and resolutions. This journey is a journey of expansion of thoughts and ideology. And this journey, this expansion, is very inspiring in itself. You will remember, Bharatiya Jan Sangh started its journey from a small office near Ajmeri Gate in Delhi. At that time we were a small party with very big dreams for the country. The dreams were big, the party was small.

When BJP was born in 1980, for some time, 10 Rajendra Prasad Marg became the party office. And earlier our Nanaji Deshmukh used to live at the same place. Many workers will remember 11 Ashok Road as the party office. After a long time, the party office shifted to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg. In a way, this is a symbol of the progress of our party. There were many ups and downs during this period.

We are the party that took the bold step to protect democracy during the Emergency, when our own party was called upon in the interest of the nation. Then, whatever happened in 1984, the nation can never forget that dark page. And the elections that were held after that, Congress got a historic majority. That atmosphere was full of emotions, an emotionally charged atmosphere, and we were almost completely wiped out in that storm. But we did not lose hope. We did not get disappointed. We did not try to find faults in anyone else. We did not get involved in the circle of allegations and counter-allegations. We went among the people once again. We worked on the ground, we strengthened our organization. And then we have reached here today.

The journey that started with 2 Lok Sabha seats has reached 303 seats in 2019. Today, we get more than 50 percent of the votes in many states. Today, from North to South, West to East, BJP is the only Pan India party. Among the family run parties, BJP is such a political party that gives a lot of opportunities and an open field to the youth to come forward. Today, the party that has the blessings of the mothers, sisters and daughters of India is called the Bharatiya Janata Party.

And friends, today BJP is not only the world's largest party. But BJP is also India's most futuristic party. We have only one goal - to build a modern and developed India of the future! And therefore, we have to set future goals for ourselves. For this, we should have modern thinking as well as modern resources. We have to develop BJP as an organization that has set goals for the next 10 years, 20 years, 50 years. For this, it is the need of the hour, it is the need of the country that three things should be in the nature of every dutiful worker, every BJP member. What are those three things - one is study, second is modernity and third is the power to assimilate good things from around the world.

We all know that wherever Pandit Deendayal ji went, books were with him. He used to read and write even while travelling. His works are a testimony to his study and intellectual expansion. Dr. Shyamaprasad Mukherjee had thousands of books in his house. This new building of the BJP office will become a centre of that tradition of the party and should become so. There is a system of study here, there is modernity and there is also the desire to gain experience from all over the world. I am sure that this modern office of the BJP will become a continuous source of inspiration for these dreams, these resolutions, this indomitable desire and enthusiasm.

Friends,


It is a matter of pride for us BJP workers that we are working in a party whose values ​​and ideology have shaped us. That party and its workers are being discussed all over the world today. Today BJP is being recognized as the most important political party in the world. Today BJP is being compared with those historical parties of the world, which changed the fate of their country during their rule. This time has come due to the sacrifice and penance of BJP workers in the last 4-5 decades. This time has come due to the development work of the BJP government. BJP is a party which is moving forward with the sole resolve to strengthen the importance of India, the potential of India. We are moving ahead with the mantra of “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas and Sabka Prayas”. And I am happy to see that many such leaders of the world are not familiar with our language, but still they try to repeat this Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas mantra. They also translate it in their language.

Friends,


Today, our North East is a great example of the mantra of Sabka Saath-Sabka Vikas. There is a lot of diversity in the population of North East. There are people from different communities, tribal and Christian communities are in abundance. People of this region are showing unprecedented faith in BJP. Today, BJP has 4 Chief Ministers in North East. We have coalition governments in 2 other states. The major credit for this success goes to the workers of BJP. Due to the hard work of BJP workers, the party is expanding far and wide in South India today. BJP has been in a strong position in Karnataka for so many years. Even today we are the number one party in Karnataka. In Telangana also, the only trust of the people, the only faith is only and only BJP. In Andhra Pradesh, people's faith in BJP is increasing day by day. In Tamil Nadu and Kerala, BJP is getting stronger day by day in every district, in every booth. This expansion of BJP, happening with the spirit of Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat, will take us to new heights of success in terms of seats and vote share.

But comrades,


I want to say one more thing. BJP cannot be understood only by its presence and influence. To understand BJP, it is important to understand its nature. And, the nature of BJP is - novelty, modernity! Newness is our devotion, and modernity is our concept. That is why, BJP is not limited to only contesting and winning elections. BJP is a system, BJP is an idea. BJP is an organization, BJP is a movement. BJP is the inspiration for development, and BJP is also the life force of change. BJP has changed the thinking of politics, and has given birth to new standards of inclusion. And an example of this is BJP's membership campaign and the expansion of the party through it.

There was a time when we were thinking that once state level committees are formed in the states, we have planted our flag in that state. Then some more time passed, the workers worked hard, then we started calculating how many districts have committees formed, in how many districts the committee is still pending, when will we complete it. Then we took a step ahead, then we started thinking that at least districts are formed, tell me in how many tehsils committees have been formed, at how many block levels committees have been formed. Then came the Shakti Kendra, then the focus shifted to the booth, and today we have reached the Panna Pramukh level.

BJP is the first party that has constitutionally provided positions for women in the party system, under the Constitution. BJP is the first party that is always ready to give new opportunities to its workers. We have started a system of bringing 25 percent new people in the party committees every time. We have reached the pinnacle of power with this strength of the workers. But even though we have reached the pinnacle of power, our feet are still as much on the ground today as they were in 1980. BJP has a very large army of such workers who, bearing hardships and problems, are constantly engaged in serving the country with a sense of duty. Wherever we work, we work with a sense of collectivity, we work with teamwork. BJP is a party in which there is free thinking, new ideas are created. New ideas are respected.

A very large class of people who think and study is a huge extension of our BJP family, a part of it. It is like a banyan tree. BJP is a party which has effective and active fronts and committees to represent different sections of the society. In BJP, every front is active in its social role and is also influential.

Friends,


This is another specialty of BJP that our party works in close association with the society. In BJP, workers are molded through social service. As you must have seen, these days BJP MPs are organizing sports competitions in their areas. The local BJP workers are shouldering a major responsibility in organizing these. Lakhs of youth of the country are getting a chance to participate in these. Thousands of youth are getting medals, avenues of progress are opening up for them. And we also get to know the strength of the region. Similarly, if there is a natural disaster, a challenge in front of the society, or a social service campaign like blood donation, BJP workers reach first, and are seen standing firm on the front till the end.

Just now the President was telling how during the Corona period, our party people went door to door to provide free ration and treatment, and at that time we did not know what we would bring back. If we brought the disease home, our lives would be in danger. Still, this is a BJP worker who used to go to every house. Today, the emotional bond that BJP and BJP workers have with the society, I cannot say whether it will be seen in any other political party or not.

Friends,


When we spend our lives in the service of society, then even when we get the opportunity to form a government, this is our priority. That is why today BJP governments across India are becoming synonymous with aspiration, development and progress. And this is BJP's brand of governance. Wherever there are BJP governments, schemes for poor welfare start running at a fast pace. Wherever there are BJP governments, the benefits of the schemes reach the beneficiaries. Wherever there are BJP governments, new opportunities are created for the youth to move forward. Wherever there are BJP governments, women empowerment starts getting top priority in the schemes. Wherever there are BJP governments, law and order gets strengthened. Wherever there are BJP governments, efforts for Ease of Doing Business, Ease of Living start increasing. Wherever there are BJP governments, infrastructure starts developing rapidly. Wherever there are BJP governments, development and legacy, development and legacy both go together.

Friends,


I think, now the time has come that our universities, academicians and experts should do a comparative study and analysis of the different governance models of India in the last 75 years. Present it before the country and the world. The country has seen a governance model of the Congress for a long time. The country has also seen the governance model of the Communists in some states. The country has also seen the way family-run parties work. The country has also seen the governance model of governments of different coalitions. And today the country is also seeing the governance model of the BJP governments with absolute majority. When it is analyzed with certain parameters, then the importance of the model of governance will be understood. The common man of the country will also know what each governance model gave to the country, what were its results and what is the better path for them!

Friends,


Today, it is very important for every worker of the Bharatiya Janata Party to understand one thing. The period that the country is going through at this time is very important for rapid development. This Amritkaal is not just a set of words. This is the reality of the earth, it is the heartbeat of 140 crore countrymen. Today we are the youngest country, a country full of self-confidence. In the whole world, on the big platforms of the world, if anyone's name is being heard today, then it is Hindustan. That name is India. In such a situation, it is natural for the anti-India forces sitting within the country and outside the country to unite. These forces want to snatch this period of development from India in any way. Today, if India's strength is again moving towards heights, then we have a strong foundation behind it. This foundation is of our constitutional institutions, of our constitutional institutions. Therefore, today, to stop India, this foundation of ours is being attacked. Constitutional institutions are being attacked, a campaign is being launched to defame them. A conspiracy is being hatched to end their credibility, their trustworthiness. When agencies take action against those involved in corruption, the agencies are attacked. When the court gives a verdict, questions are raised on the court, the judicial system is attacked. You all are seeing, some parties have jointly launched a campaign to save the corrupt. Today, all the faces involved in corruption are coming together on one platform. The whole country is watching this, the country is understanding this.

Friends,


Corruption has caused a lot of damage to our country. Corruption has hollowed out the country like termites. Today the people of the country are seeing how the previous governments only did a formality in the name of action against corruption. But the campaign launched by the BJP government against corruption in the last 9 years has shaken the roots of both corruption and the corrupt. This is proof of the fact that when the BJP comes, corruption runs away. Today I want to tell you some figures. Under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act i.e. PMLA, during the Congress government, i.e. between the years 2004 to 2014, property worth around Rs 5 thousand crores was seized. 5 thousand crores. Under this Act, in the last 9 years, the BJP government has seized property worth more than Rs 1 lakh 10 thousand crores. Under this Act, more than double the number of cases have been registered as compared to earlier and 15 times more people have been arrested. Some people in our country looted banks during the Congress rule. After causing a loss of about 22 thousand crores to the banks, these people fled abroad. Today, the BJP government has confiscated their property worth about 20 thousand crores. In the last 9 years, the CBI has registered about 5 thousand cases under the Prevention of Corruption Act. In the BJP government, hundreds of senior officials surrounded by corruption charges were shown the Constitution, the rules of the government and they were forcibly retired, sent home, and action was taken against them.


Friends,


For the first time in the 7 decades of independence, corruption is being hit in such a way. The people of the entire country are happy with the action being taken against the corrupt today. This is what you know, right? Wherever I go, people say - Modi Ji, don't stop. Today every citizen of the country understands - only when corruption will stop, the country will move forward. And when you do so much, some people will definitely get angry. They will also vent their anger. But neither will the country bow down to their false allegations, nor will the action against corruption stop.

Friends,


You must remember, Congress leaders used to say once, during the Jansangh era. Big leaders used to say that they will uproot Jansangh and throw it away. Their big leaders used to say this. And today's Congress says that Modi, your grave will be dug. There were many conspiracies to destroy Jansangh and BJP. And these are the people who laid many traps to put me in jail, but they failed completely. If we have survived, flourished, it is because of the blessings of the people. We have grown with the love of the countrymen. The immense love of the countrymen, this is our capital, this gives us strength. This gives us power. We have moved forward with the blessings of the countrymen, are moving forward and will continue to move forward. If we move forward from here, that too will grow with the trust of the countrymen.

Friends,


BJP is not a party that was born from newspapers or the glow of TV screens. This BJP was not born from Twitter handles and YouTube channels. This BJP was built from the sacrifice and penance of its workers. BJP has progressed by working on the ground. BJP has progressed by working shoulder to shoulder with the poor in villages, in fields and barns. Many people tell me, hey Modiji, now you have got power, you have become the Prime Minister twice, why do you still keep running so much, why do you keep running, hey, have fun sometimes, relax. But those people do not know that the destiny of a BJP worker cannot be to relax, sit, have fun. For a BJP worker, the hopes of the country, the aspirations of the people, their dreams are his driving force. For this, the BJP worker runs, runs, works day and night, he does not stop, does not get tired, does not even bow down. But friends, we have to remember, this fight of ours is not easy. BJP has to fight corruption at every step. BJP has to fight nepotism at every step. BJP has to fight communalism at every step. BJP has to fight casteism at every step. BJP has to fight anti-India foreign forces and their ecosystem at every step. Because these are the challenges that have caused a lot of damage to the country, have caused damage for a long time.

Friends,


Very fortunately, due to the sacrifice and penance of many, we have got the opportunity to serve the nation and build the nation in the Amrit Kaal of Independence. We Indians have set the goal of a developed India by 2047, when we will celebrate 100 years of independence. From the Amrit Mahotsav of Independence to 100 years of independence, every BJP worker has to work hard in this journey of the country. Our workers should be prepared for a long innings. Just as many generations were spent in building the party, in the same way we will have to spend our generations to take the country forward.

Friends,


I want to remind you of something I said in February 2018 in this office. While inaugurating this building in 2018, I had said that this office is our karmabhoomi, but the border of India is the limit of our work. Taking energy from this building, we have to make the border of entire India our work area. I have full faith that all of you will continue to make the dreams of the country come true with this penance. The dream that we had seen earlier, we are seeing it being fulfilled today. The dream that we are seeing today, will be fulfilled in the future. With this belief, on this auspicious occasion and amidst the holy festival of Navratri, I give many good wishes to all of you, countrymen.

Thank you very much!


Of Mother India. Of Mother India. Of Mother India.


Vande, vande, vande, vande, vande, vande, vande, vande, vande.
