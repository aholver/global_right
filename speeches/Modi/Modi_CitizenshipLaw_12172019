Bharat Mata ki Jai , Bharat Mata ki Jai , Bharat Mata ki Jai. Just before coming here, I had the privilege of paying homage to immortal martyrs Sidhu Kanhu and Chand Bhairav. You might have thought that the helicopter had come, why did the Prime Minister not come, but the Prime Minister had gone there to pay his head. It is my another privilege that today my last meeting for the Jharkhand Assembly elections this time is being held on the land of heroes and in the presence of Baba Bageshwar Nath. With the blessings of such brave men and women, the BJP government is building museums related to tribal fighters all over the country .

India will always remember the contribution of these tribal heroes in every corner of India in the freedom struggle of India , in the creation of India . It is our wish that the coming generations should be inspired by them. I bow to all such pious souls , I salute their struggle. Friends , four phases of voting have been completed in Jharkhand and in every phase there has been heavy voting , peaceful voting. The voters of Jharkhand have voted without any fear. This time also there is only one voice everywhere - Jharkhand Pukara BJP Dobara , Jharkhand Pukara BJP Dobara , Jharkhand Pukara BJP Dobara. Brothers and sisters, this voice has become loud because the lotus flower has guaranteed development and security to Jharkhand. When the lotus flower blooms, the poor are benefited , women are benefited , youth are benefited , tribals are benefited , backward areas are benefited , the entire society is benefited.

Friends , ever since the BJP and NDA governments have been in power in the country, we have worked in the interest of every class and every community. If Rs 36,000 crore have been deposited directly in the bank accounts of crores of farmer families across the country, including Jharkhand, then this has been deposited in the accounts of farmers of every class and every community , no discrimination has been allowed. Crores of poor farmers , farm labourers , workers in the unorganised sector , small shopkeepers and businessmen across the country have received the facility of a pension of Rs 3,000, and this too has been given to all without any discrimination. More than eight crore sisters across the country, including Jharkhand, have received free gas connections for the first time. Tribals , backward classes , Dalits , general category , people of every sect and community are also benefiting from this. If houses are being built for about two crore poor people of the country and 10 lakh poor people of Jharkhand, then this too is being done without any discrimination . We are working so that those who do not have a house get it . Under Ayushman Bharat, every poor person is getting free treatment up to Rs 5 lakh every year. Under this scheme, about 67 lakh poor families across the country and more than 2 lakh poor families in Jharkhand have already received free treatment.

Brothers and sisters , when a poor person , a tribal person feels that he has someone of his own who is taking care of him , his children sitting in Delhi, then my brother , my sisters , my mothers living in the poorest of the poor forests shower their blessings on us. You see, wherever I look from far and wide, there are people everywhere. You have come here in such a large number to bless me , to bless us all. This affection , this blessing of yours troubles JMM , Congress , RJD and the leftists across the country, it disturbs their sleep. They are not able to digest the love that Modi and BJP are getting from the country , they are not able to understand that why the things about which they scared the country for decades turned out to be lies , all they spread was lies, now the truth has come out that if there is the most security anywhere, it is in the BJP governments. They are worried about how the cases which were kept pending for decades , the issues which worried , agitated and troubled the people, were resolved today by Modi .

Friends , Ram-Janaki are seated in our Barhet and Lord Ram ji spent his life among the tribals in exile for 14 years and that is why there is a grand centre of faith , a temple of Ram ji here. Now you tell me , the matter of Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya was hanging for so many years , should it have been resolved or not , should this issue have been resolved peacefully or not , everyone should have walked on the path of truth or not but why did it not happen ? Because they did the same work in which their political breads kept getting baked. It did not happen because Congress and its allies never wanted a solution to this , their political interests were cooked in hanging and delaying it. They kept doing politics , kept scaring everyone and the country kept waiting for Ram temple in Ayodhya. My dear brothers and sisters , we followed the national policy and the way for the construction of a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya has been cleared today brothers and sisters. Was there any tension , any riots , any fighting , was it done peacefully or not , should all work in the country be done peacefully or not ? Now Modi is trying to do everything peacefully, so he is worried.

Brothers and sisters , they showed the same fear regarding Article 370 , if you touch 370, you will get an electric shock , there will be chaos , the country will be divided. This is what they used to say , this is what they showed fear, right ? They allowed separatism to grow in Jammu and Kashmir , allowed terrorism to grow , Pandits were expelled from there , they kept watching but did not take a decision , did not take a decision. When you again ordered this servant, Article 370 was also removed and today Kashmir has moved forward peacefully. Friends , you rejected this fear , this deceit. The whole country rejected the negative thinking of Congress and its allies. But friends , they have made scaring people , spreading false things the basis of their politics.

They cannot do politics by serving the people , they are still relying on their habit of doing politics by spreading lies and creating an atmosphere of fear. Now see, they have again started telling white lies about the Citizenship Amendment Act , they have started scaring people. Congress and parties like it and its leftist ecosystem have put in all their strength to scare the Muslims of India. These people are creating an atmosphere of lies and fear in the country , spreading violence while it is as clear as stone that the Citizenship Amendment Act will not affect the citizenship of any citizen of India , be it Hindu , Muslim , Christian or Parsi . You understood this point of mine, you understood it , did I tell it clearly or not ? I told it in the Parliament also , you understand it, they do not understand it because their political mess is not getting cooked.

Brothers and sisters , still Congress and its allies are spreading lies , rumours and propaganda . Friends , today from this land of Jharkhand , the land of these brave sons, the land of these martyrs who died for the country, I want to tell the entire country , every citizen of the country, be it Hindu or Muslim , that this law will not affect the citizenship of any Indian citizen. The law we have made is for the people who come to India due to religious persecution in three neighboring countries , Bangladesh , Pakistan , Afghanistan . This law has been made for those people who have been in a very pitiable condition for years , who have no way to return. I want to ask where does this violate the rights of Indian Muslims or any Indian citizen. Why are you lying , why are you spreading lies , why are you hell-bent on destroying the country.

Friends , the Citizenship Amendment Act neither takes away the rights of any Indian nor harms him in any way, but still the Congress and its allies want to cook up their political porridge by trying to provoke , scare and intimidate Muslims on this issue. Brothers and sisters , due to the Congress's divide and rule policy, the country has been divided once , Mother India has been divided earlier , this is the Congress. Lakhs of illegal infiltrators were allowed to enter India , they were used as vote bank here , the Congress and its allies who have been enjoying power for so many years are responsible for the problems created due to the infiltrators.

Friends , I challenge all those parties including Congress from this land of heroes today. Friends , tell me , should I challenge or not , I have your blessings , should this voice be raised from the land of heroes or not ? Today I openly challenge Congress and all their followers , all their allies , if they have the courage, they should openly declare that they are ready to give citizenship to every citizen of Pakistan in India , just say it , the country will settle their accounts. Not only this, if Congress has the courage, they should also openly declare that they will implement Article 370 again in Jammu Kashmir and Ladakh, just say it , if you have the courage, then say it. Modi has removed it, you should announce before the country that you will bring it back , are you misleading the people ?

If Congress has the courage, if Congress allies have the courage, then they should also openly declare that they will repeal the law made against triple talaq, tell me with courage. Congress should accept this challenge, declare openly or else stop lying to the country, spreading confusion in the country, doing this guerilla politics by making others your shield. I also want to tell Congress and its allies that they should stop playing this game of ruining the youth of the country, it will not benefit anyone, it will not benefit the bright future of the country. Do not commit the sin of destroying the dreams of those parents who have sent their children to study by doing hard labour, for your politics. The country is seeing how cleanly Congress has stopped talking about the Citizenship Amendment Act, Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) but by raising other issues, hiding behind it, it has started spreading fear, spreading confusion, fuelling dirty politics.

Let me make it clear again that the Government of India has only one holy book, the Constitution of India given by Baba Saheb Ambedkar, this is our book. Only one mantra is paramount for us, only one mantra is our inspiration, only one mantra inspires us to make efforts and that mantra is Bharat Mata Ki Jai. We are living, struggling and engaged with this mantra only and only Bharat Mata Ki Jai. Your servant will stand with every decision taken within its scope for the welfare of Mother India, for the Jai-Jai of Mother India.

I also request the young friends of the colleges and universities of the country to understand their importance , understand this valuable time of your life , understand the importance of the institutions where you are studying. Discuss and debate the decisions and policies of the government , if you find something wrong then protest in a democratic way , convey your views to the government. This government listens to your every word , your every sentiment , understands it but you also have to understand that some parties , so-called urban Naxals , people calling themselves intellectuals are not fulfilling their political interests by firing guns on your shoulders , is there a conspiracy behind your destruction. Remember, and this country has been seeing this for 20 years , they only hate Modi. Be it any issue related to the national interest , they are not able to see beyond their hatred for Modi.

Brothers and sisters , JMM , Congress , RJD and leftists have different names , their thinking and deeds are the same. They had done politics of lies and fear in the same way regarding the creation of Jharkhand. When Jharkhand was a part of Bihar, they lied to the people there , scared them, but due to your struggle and BJP's commitment, today Jharkhand is playing an important role in the development of the country. However, even today Congress , JMM and RJD are doing the work of scaring the tribals , backwards and Dalits like before , and again lies are being propagated here. Somewhere they are scaring the backwards and somewhere they are scaring the tribals. Brothers and sisters , from this land of Sidhu Kanhu, I once again assure the entire tribal society , tribal friends that there will be no harm to your water , your forest and your land. Development will happen here only with your faith. You know, they used to keep saying that if Modi comes, reservation will go away. Did they spread lies or not ? Did they lie or not ? Did they lie day and night or not ? We have recently pushed the reservation law forward in the parliament , and last week the Modi government has extended it for another 10 years. Now they are speechless , their mouths are shut , not a single lie of theirs will work.

Friends, BJP's resolution, our only resolution is that the country should develop, Jharkhand should develop. BJP is dedicated to your welfare and to fulfill your dreams, that is why we are focusing on your basic problems. In the last five years, we focused on works like roads and electricity, provided toilets and gas connections to our sisters. In the coming five years, with the same dedication, we are engaged in the work of providing water to every house. We are working to ensure that water reaches every house by the year 2024. The Bharatiya Janata Party, this lotus flower government, is doing this work so that farmers and our sisters do not have to worry about water. For this, we have created a separate ministry and have also started work under the Jal-Jeevan Mission. Under this, three and a half lakh crore rupees will be spent in the coming five years, out of which more than 200 crores have already been approved for Jharkhand. It is very important to form a BJP government here so that this money is used properly and water pipes reach every village properly. Otherwise, if the government of looters is formed, they will not only not give you water, but this money that is your right will also be looted. If their intention was to give you water, then you would not have to wait so long for water from the pipe. Once clean water reaches your home, many diseases will go away on their own. 

Friends, this area is rich in Gumani and Meral streams, you have also got the blessings of Maa Ganga. This water can be used for drinking and irrigation as well as employment, this thought never even occurred to the Congress and JMM governments. Before independence, there was a lot of trade and business with foreign countries from here, but after independence, the Congress-JMM governments stopped this too. Brothers and sisters, it is the BJP government that has taken the initiative to use the water of Ganga for transportation and traffic. The way for ships to ply on Ganga from Haldia to Varanasi has been cleared. Here in Sahibganj too, the work of building a multimodal terminal is going on at a fast pace today. This will connect Sahibganj to all parts of the country and abroad by water routes, the coal-based industries here will also benefit from this. Washing of stone chips, fertilizers, cement and sugar as well as other goods will also be done easily, that is, new avenues will open here for new industries, trade and business. Friends, giving priority to the development of this area, all other facilities of movement including railway are also being strengthened here. Efforts are also being made to remove the problems related to the construction of the bridge on Ganga ji which is to be started here. Friends, there are already many ancient temples here, there is also an ancient soul here. In such a situation, when connectivity improves, the tourism industry will also expand, then employment opportunities will be created in this area.

Brothers and sisters, the BJP government wants to make Jharkhand a hub of silk and cloth. For this, crores of rupees have been given to Jharkhand in the last five years. The result of this is that where earlier 2 thousand metric tons were produced every year, now nearly 2700 metric tons are produced. The result of this is that in the last five years, nearly two lakh new jobs have been created in the silk industry alone. The BJP government is engaged in strengthening the silk production units here. Many works are being done to ensure that the Forest Department and the Tribal Department work together to produce silk and give it a new market. Not only this, thousands of weaver families and handicraftsmen here have been given ID cards for the first time. It has now become easier for them to take loans from banks for machines and raw materials.

Under the Mudra Yojana, they are able to get loans without guarantee. Friends , our effort is to strengthen the role of women in the village economy , for this we are constantly working on new schemes. Who benefited the most from the Ujjwala Yojana? Our mothers and sisters , our sisters and daughters. Who benefited the most from the toilet ? Our sisters and daughters. Our sisters and daughters benefited the most from the Mudra Yojana , even the right to become the owner of the house was given by the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana , that too was given to our sisters and daughters. The BJP government here has gone a step ahead and has made it possible to register the property in the name of women for just one rupee.

Brothers and sisters , not only this, we are also empowering Sakhi Mandals , linking them with self-employment. It is the BJP government that has cleared the way for women to work in mines , has made a law related to this, due to which all these sisters of Jharkhand are getting the most benefit. Friends , BJP's effort is that the sons and daughters of tribal areas should study well , also progress in sports. For this, the facility of Eklavya Model School is being created in every block of Jharkhand. Van-Dhan Kendras are being established so that tribal families get higher prices for the produce they collect from the forest.

Brothers and sisters , BJP government is very important to continue many facilities like free treatment , gas connection , money being given to farmers , pucca houses etc. These five years are very important to decide your future for the next 50 years, otherwise where there is no BJP government, obstacles are being created in providing these facilities to the people , walls are being built , no matter how much effort I put in from Delhi, they stop us in the capital too. Rapid development of Jharkhand is possible only when there are double engine governments with the same thinking and same objective in Delhi and Ranchi. Keeping this in mind, you have to press the button on the flower symbol. Remember, your vote is not just for making an MLA , not just for making a Chief Minister , it is to form a government that shows development. Your vote will strengthen not only Jharkhand but also me and that is why I urge you all once again to come in large numbers and press the lotus button during the last phase of voting and give the Bharatiya Janata Party and me a chance to serve you. Once again, many thanks to all of you , to every colleague of Jharkhand. Bharat Mata ki Jai , Bharat Mata ki Jai , Bharat Mata ki Jai , many thanks.
