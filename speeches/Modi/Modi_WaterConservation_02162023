Pramukh Rajyogini Dadi Ratan Mohini ji of Brahma Kumaris organisation, my cabinet colleague Gajendra Singh Shekhawat ji, all the members of Brahma Kumaris organisation, other dignitaries, ladies and gentlemen! I am happy that I am here at the launch of 'Jal-Jan Abhiyan' started by Brahma Kumaris. It has always been special for me to come among all of you and to learn from you. The blessings I received from late Rajyogini Dadi Janki ji are my biggest asset. I remember paying my homage to Dadi Prakash Mani ji in Abu Road after her demise. Over the past few years, I have received many warm invitations from Brahma Kumari sisters for different programs. I always try to be amongst you as a member of this spiritual family.

Whenever I come among you, be it the 'Future of Power' program in Ahmedabad in 2011, the 75 years of establishment of the institution, the Sangam Teerthdham in 2013, the 80th foundation day of Brahma Kumaris Sansthan in 2017, or the last year’s program related to Amrit Mahotsav, your love and affinity overwhelms me. My relationship with Brahma Kumaris is also special because rising above the self and dedicating everything for the society has been a form of spiritual practice for all of you.

Friends,

The 'Jal-Jan Abhiyan' is being launched at a time when water scarcity is being seen as a future crisis all over the world. The 21st century world is realizing the seriousness of limited water resources on earth. Due to its large population, water security is an important responsibility, even for India. That's why in the ‘Amrit Kaal’ of independence, today the country, as the saying goes “Jal hai to Kal hai”, is looking at water as 'tomorrow'. There will be tomorrow only if there is water. Therefore, we will have to make efforts in this regard together from today itself. I am satisfied that the country is now taking forward the resolution of water conservation as a mass movement. The 'Jal-Jan Abhiyan' of Brahma Kumaris will give new strength to this effort of public participation. It will not only widen the reach of the water conservation campaign, but its effectiveness will also increase. I heartily congratulate all the senior leaders associated with the Brahma Kumaris organization and its lakhs of followers.

Friends,

Thousands of years ago, sages of India had created a restrained, balanced and sensitive system regarding nature, environment and water. There is a saying in our country that we should not destroy water, but conserve it. This spirit has been a part of our spirituality for thousands of years and is a part of our religion. This is the culture of our society, the center of our social thinking. That's why we treat water as God and consider rivers as mother. When a society makes such an emotional connection with nature, then sustainable development becomes its natural way of life. Therefore, while seeking solutions to the challenges of the future today, we must rekindle that consciousness of the past. We have to instill the same faith in the countrymen towards the values of water conservation. We also have to remove every distortion that causes water pollution. And, as always, India's spiritual institutions like the Brahma Kumaris have an important role to play in this regard.

Friends,

Over the past decades, such a negative thinking had developed in our country that we considered issues like water conservation and environment problematic and left them unattended. Some people had assumed that these were such challenging issues that could not be implemented! But the country has changed this mindset in the last 8-9 years, and the situation has also changed. 'Namami Gange' is a strong example of this. Today, not only the Ganges, but all its tributaries are also getting cleaned. Campaigns like natural farming have also started on the banks of the Ganges. The 'Namami Gange' campaign has today emerged as a model for various states of the country.

Friends,

Like water pollution, the depleting ground water table is also a major challenge for the country. The country has started 'Catch the rain' movement in this regard which is now progressing rapidly. Water conservation is also being promoted in thousands of gram panchayats of the country through Atal Bhujal Yojana. The campaign to construct 75 Amrit Sarovar in every district of the country is also a major step towards water conservation.

Friends,

Women in our country have traditionally been the torchbearers of important issues of life like water conservation. Today women in the villages of the country are also leading important schemes like Jal Jeevan Mission through ‘Pani Samiti’ (water committees). Our Brahma Kumari sisters can play the same role in the country as well as at the global level. Along with water conservation, we have to raise all the issues related to the environment with equal vigor. The country is promoting techniques like drip irrigation for balanced use of water in agriculture. You should motivate the farmers to use it aggressively. Now the entire world is also celebrating International Millet Year on the initiative of India. Millets such as Shree Anna Bajra and Shree Anna Jowar have been a part of cultivation and food habits in our country for centuries. Millets are rich in nutrition and also take less water in cultivation. Therefore, if you motivate people to include more coarse grains in their diet, then this campaign will gain strength and water conservation will also get a boost.

I am sure our joint efforts will make the 'Jal-Jan Abhiyan' successful and we will build a better India and a better future. Many best wishes to all of you once again. Om Shanti!
