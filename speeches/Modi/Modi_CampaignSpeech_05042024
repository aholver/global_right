I salute this holy land of King Janaka, Sita Maiya and Kaviraj Vidyapati.

I also salute late Maharaja Kameshwar Singh Ji from the land of Darbhanga. Firstly, this holy land of Mithila and secondly, the blessings of you, the people, what can be a greater fortune than this. (How much will you make Modi dance, tell the SPG people to capture Modi. You have brought him here very well, thank you very much) Say, Bharat Mata Ki, Bharat Mata Ki. (Give this to the SPG people) Jai Shri Ram, Jai Shri Ram. I also congratulate all of you for the construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. Our wait has ended after 500 years. Our ancestors kept struggling for 500 years, kept sacrificing and never got disappointed. Our ancestors knew that someday a son will be born, someday a son will be born who will complete the wait of 500 years and build Lord Ram Mandir. And the wait was not just for Ram ji, it was also for Sita Maiya and our Mithila. We are seeing this auspicious time in our lifetime (O Vishwakarma devotee, keep yourself down, people cannot see from behind. I have seen you, stay happy.) This auspicious time is a very big thing for us.

Friends,

When the consecration of Ram Lalla was taking place in Ayodhya, I had said that India will write the future of the next thousand years. Sometimes a single incident in history decides the fate of many centuries. (My request to all of you is that I know you are facing trouble, it is possible that you are unable to see me, but please forgive me for that. Listen to me comfortably from wherever you are. And if you lower your volume, it will be easier for me to speak. I have your blessings when I start speaking. You will remain silent. You are such good people.) A thousand years ago, when attacks on India started from the West, no one had thought that India would be engulfed in slavery for a thousand years. Bihar, which used to show direction to the country, was surrounded by such crises that everything was destroyed. But friends, today the fate of India has taken a turn once again. The fate of Bihar has taken a turn once again. This period has come in the 21st century, when India has once again broken all its chains and stood up. Today, India's credibility in the world is at a new height. Today, India has reached the moon, where no one has reached. 10 years ago, we were the 11th largest economy in the world. In just 10 years, we have become the 5th largest economy. You must remember the time of Corona. Such a big crisis of 100 years had come. The whole world thought that India is gone, India will be ruined. The world will also ruin it. Everyone was wondering what will happen now. But at that time, India showed what India's strength is. India pulled out of that crisis, showed the way to the world as well. But friends, I can never forget what the Congress and the Indi alliance did to the people of Bihar in such a big crisis. There was an Indi alliance government in Delhi, there was an Indi alliance government in Maharashtra and these people conspired and sent the people of Bihar back from there during that crisis. The youth of my Bihar, the daughters of my Bihar have been driven away from Delhi by the Indi alliance government. I want to ask the youth of Bihar, will you forgive those who did this injustice to you? Will you settle the score in this election or not? People of Bihar were put on buses and left midway. And today these same Indi alliance people are coming to ask for votes from you. Will you forgive this big crime of Indi alliance? Will you forgive?

brothers Sisters,

In this election, I have given a roadmap for development for the next 5 years. I have put forward a vision of 25 years before the country. But, it is also important that we also keep in mind the past. Just like there is a prince in Delhi, there is a prince in Patna too. One prince has considered the whole country as his estate since childhood and the other prince has considered the whole of Bihar as his estate. The report cards of these two princes are the same. There is nothing in their report cards except scams and unbridled law and order. Remember, how the kidnapping industry used to run in Bihar? How Bihar's treasury was looted through big scams? How our sisters and daughters were afraid to leave the house in the evening? How land was taken in their name before giving jobs? Friends, today the NDA government under the leadership of Nitish ji is working day and night for the development of Bihar. Our inspiration is Karpoori Babu, to whom we had the good fortune of giving Bharat Ratna some time ago. In the last 10 years, we have given concrete houses to 40 lakh poor people in Bihar, about 1.25 crore gas connections. Today, the poor are getting free ration and free treatment. Now Modi has also decided that if there is any elderly person above 70 years of age in your family in Bihar, then now their children will not have to bear the cost of their treatment. Now this expense will be borne by your son in Delhi. Every elderly person above 70 years of age will get free treatment up to Rs 5 lakh. My friends from Bihar, my friends from Darbhanga, will you do one thing for me, just raise your hand and tell me, will you do it, will you do it, see, do one thing, when you will be going from village to village these days, going to the neighborhood, going to small settlements. If any such family comes to your notice there, who are yet to get a concrete house, gas connection, tap water connection, Ayushman card has not reached, then tell them that Modi ji has guaranteed, after the formation of the new government after June 4, we are going to build three crore new houses. So you give a guarantee to all the families on my behalf. For me, you are Modi.


Friends,

Be it Darbhanga's airport, railway station, Amrit-Bharat train, modern roads, work is going on everywhere. The obstacles of Darbhanga AIIMS are also being removed. Friends, when the foundation of development is strong, only then industries and employment are created. An IT park has also been built here in Darbhanga, which will create new opportunities for the youth. Makhana, litchi and mango are grown in abundance in Mithila. Its export will increase with good roads and infrastructure. To make the Makhana here reach the world, our government has also given GI tag to Makhana. Friends, we have given assistance of Rs 42 thousand crore to women self-help groups in Bihar from banks. 11 lakh women are associated with these groups in Darbhanga-Madhubani. These sisters have also started Shilpgram in Darbhanga. And Modi himself promotes your Madhubani paintings all over the world. This happiness of our sisters moving forward today, is what encourages Modi to work hard.

Friends,

You know that our constitution was made after a long discussion. At that time, there was the most discussion on one issue. Baba Saheb Ambedkar was there, Dr. Rajendra Babu was there, there were great scholars of the country, and whether to give reservation on the basis of religion in the constitution or not. There was a serious discussion on this. And the Constituent Assembly under the leadership of Baba Saheb decided 75 years ago that we cannot give reservation on the basis of religion in our country. The country cannot be divided again. Baba Saheb Ambedkar openly advocated that there will be no reservation on the basis of religion. Not only this, Pandit Nehru also opposed reservation on the basis of religion. But now when our poor SC-ST-OBC have become disillusioned with the Congress, the Congress is going against the sentiments of Nehru ji. It is stabbing Baba Saheb Ambedkar in the back, it is engaged in twisting the Constitution. Congress is engaged in reducing the OBC quota and giving reservation to Muslims by robbing it on the basis of religion. Rob the reservation of Dalits, Rob the reservation of tribals and RJD is also walking shoulder to shoulder in this conspiracy of Congress. In 2007, the father of the prince of Bihar had talked about removing Muslims from this reservation and giving them quota. While being the railway minister, he had told the railway officials to arrange quota for Muslims. Think, they want to snatch the reservation of SC-ST-OBC and give it to Muslims. You tell me, if SC-ST-OBC reservation is cut on the basis of religion, will the right of Yadav-Kurmi community also remain? Everything will be finished. They are trying to rob the rights of Paswan, Musahar, Ravidas, Dhanuk community. Friends, for the last 12 days I have been challenging Congress and its henchmen on the issue of reservation. I have told them, I have demanded in writing that the Indy alliance will not snatch the reservation of SC-ST-OBC on the basis of religion and give it to Muslims. We will not tamper with the Constitution for reservation on the basis of religion. But they have sin in their stomach. I have been demanding this for 12 days. They are sitting silently. Friends, I assure you that as long as Modi is alive, I will never let anyone tamper with the reservation of SC-ST-OBC.

Friends,

Ever since I exposed the intentions of Congress-RJD, these people have become nervous. Now RJD has started counting who is a Hindu and who is a Muslim in the army. This is their real face. These people can do anything to divide the society, to break the unity of the country. The one who takes a bullet on his chest to protect Maa Bharati is an Indian first. And these RJD people see him as a Hindu-Muslim. I want to ask those who divide Hindus and Muslims. Do we remember Abdul Hamid ji only because he was a Muslim? Will these people take the country in this direction? These are the people who question the surgical strike, the air strike. These are the people who abuse the Army Chief. After all, to please whom, on whose instructions is this said? The country is watching everything. The public knows everything. The countrymen are watching everything. Friends, RJD's history has always been of appeasement under the mask of social justice. When the karsevaks were burnt alive in Godhra, the Railway Minister was this prince's father, who is serving his sentence and roaming around on bail. To save the culprits, he formed a committee of a Supreme Court judge. Benraji Committee. It was Sonia ma'am's rule, right. And that is why he formed Benraji Committee. The judge's name was Benraji, so everyone called him Benraji. And he got such a report written that the people who burnt 60 karsevaks were acquitted, but this Railway Minister, who is forced to spend his life in jail, is roaming around on bail. The court threw his report in the dustbin. And they were all sentenced, even sentenced to death. The whole world knew that the karsevaks were burnt alive. But, then a conspiracy was hatched to put the blame on the karsevaks by preparing a fake investigation report. This is their history, this is their truth.

Friends,

We must not let Bihar go back to the era of lanterns. Now you will know that these princes from Delhi have come up with a new idea. You tell me, brothers and sisters, do the parents work hard and save something or not. They save something or the other, they have a desire to build a small house, it will be useful for the children. Buy a small car, it will be useful for the children. Buy a piece of land, it will be useful for the children. Every parent has this desire to leave something for their children after their death. Every parent has this desire. Now Congress wants to make such a law that if their government is formed in Delhi, you will not get what your parents have earned. If your father has a 10-acre field, he will not be able to give it to you, if he has two houses, he will not be able to give it to you. Their government will snatch half of it, they want to bring this fatwa of imposing 55 percent tax on inheritance. Will you let any government loot your hard-earned money? Will you let any government loot it? Will they let Congress loot? Will they let RJD loot? And therefore, brothers and sisters, to save your future, to build the future of your children, vote for JDU candidate Shri Rampreet Mandal ji in Jhanjharpur on 7th May, BJP candidate Shri Gopal Thakur ji in Darbhanga on 13th May and our daughter from LJP, Smt. Shambhavi Chaudhary ji from Samastipur, the youngest daughter in entire India is contesting the election. All of you bless them, our daughter must win. Vote for BJP candidate Shri Ashok Kumar Yadav ji in Madhubani on 20th May, and all our colleagues in large numbers. When you vote for them, these votes will go directly to Modi's account. Modi will get strength and Modi will serve you strongly for five more years. So, we will go door-to-door, get maximum votes cast, first vote then refreshment, we will ensure this. Ok, will you do one thing for me? Just raise your hand and tell me what you will do. After leaving from here, go to every house and tell that our Modi ji came to Darbhanga and Modi ji has greeted you. I will convey my regards. I will convey my regards to every home.

Say,
Bharat Mata ki Jai.
Bharat Mata ki Jai.
Bharat Mata ki Jai.
Thank you very much!
