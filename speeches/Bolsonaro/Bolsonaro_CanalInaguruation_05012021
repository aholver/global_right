The printed vote has a name, the mother is congresswoman Bia Kicis from Brasília and the father is Arthur Lira, hello yesterday's committee, congratulations Arthur, it's a pleasure to be on your side here.

Friends from the Northeast, it really is priceless to be among you and to be welcomed in this way.

I confess that I have no words to express such gratitude and satisfaction, thank you all very much.

God gave me a second life and you, through his hands, gave me this mandate, I just want to serve you all, you can be sure you have a president who is on the side of the people, a people to whom we owe absolute loyalty.

We are together no matter what, no one dares change the color of our flag or try to hinder our freedom.

This work here in our State of Alagoas is one of the many that, thank God, we have been able to complete throughout our mandate, works that seemed endless but with a team of competent ministers like here Rogério Marinho from MDR, our great minister from Rio Grande do Norte we are managing to do this there.

I only ask God for one thing to give us strength, wisdom and courage to face the challenges and complete our mandate so that we can say in the future that we did our best.

You deserve it, you are truly men and women who suffer from the drought in the Northeast, but this is slowly being left behind.

Thank you all very much and until a new inauguration, God willing.
