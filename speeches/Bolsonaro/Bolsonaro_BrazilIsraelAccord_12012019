My dear brother, friend captain and paratrooper,

Many things unite us, obviously the most important, traditions, Brazil's participation in the recognition of the State of Israel as well as our Judeo-Christian culture. Brazil took a turn, the ideological condition ceased to exist. We seek to expand our business, we want to bring Brazil closer and closer to the best in the world. We have other trips planned and we intend to place Brazil in the prominent place it deserves. The examples we have, among others, is the State of Israel. We have twenty-six states in Brazil and Israel is smaller than the smallest of our states, the state of Sergipe, but we are proud to see the grandeur of the Israeli nation.

These partnerships, these agreements that we will sign shortly will be very beneficial for our people.

Therefore, I am grateful for the generosity of the welcome and for this to be an example for many that we want the best for our people. I want a big Brazil and we want Israel to be bigger and bigger.

Dear brother, thank you for your hospitality. A big hug to everyone here in your country.
